0,4,Comparison Between SVM and Back Propagation Neural Network in Building IDS,"Recently, applying the novel data mining techniques for anomaly detection-an element in Intrusion Detection System has received much research alternation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Back Propagation Neural (BPN) network has been applied successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, we use an approach that is entropy based analysis method to characterize some common types of attack like scanning attack. A model based on SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel is also proposed here for building anomaly detection system. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and most general methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The comparative results show that with attack scenarios that we create and through the differences between the performance measures, we found that SVM gives higher precision and lower error rate than BPN method.",1,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

Several techniques have been introduced in an effort to minimize up to some extent the risk associated with Intrusion attack. In this paper, we have used two novel Machine Learning techniques including Multinomial Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayesian in building Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Also, we create our own dataset based on four attack scenarios including TCP flood, ICMP flood, UDP flood and Scan port.

Based on two recent works on direct density ratio estimation which are kernel mean matching and unconstrained least squares importance fitting, we propose to modify two well-known classification techniques: neural networks with back propagation and support vector machine in order to make these techniques work better under covariate shift effect.

3,7,A LSTM based framework for handling multiclass imbalance in DGA botnet detection,"In recent years, botnets have become a major threat on the Internet. Most sophisticated bots use Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) to pseudo-randomly generate a large number of domains and select a subset in order to communicate with Command and Control (C&C) server. The basic aim is to avoid blacklisting, sinkholing and evade the security systems. Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) provides a mean to combat this botnet type. It operates on raw domains and is amenable to immediate applications. LSTM is however prone to multiclass imbalance problem, which becomes even more significant in DGA malware detection. This is due the fact that many DGA classes have a very little support in the training dataset.

9,13,Factors affecting employee engagement at not-for-profit organizations: A case in Vietnam,"The paper examines the determinants of employee engagement in the not-for-profit organization (NFPO) sector. A structured questionnaire survey of 205 NFPO employees in Vietnam was employed, preceded by in-depth interviews with NFPO associates and managers. After a multiple regression analysis to study the impact of five independent variables on one dependent variable, the study reveals that Work design and Work-life balance are positively and significantly associated with employee engagement. Of which, Work design is measured by the level of job fit, job autonomy, job challenge, and job meaningfulness. On the other hand, Work-life balance involves measurement aspects consisting of how reasonable the workload is and organizational support. Meanwhile, different from the business world, Leadership, Learning and Development, and Recognition do not show statistically positive impacts on employee engagement in NFPOs. Still, they are crucial back-supporting factors to ensure employee experience at work.

In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the queue management mechanism BLUE to ensure the quality of the video data stream which always requires large resources when the state of network transmission is unstable.

We find that the impacts are a mixture of both positives and negatives. Positive effects include a more and more developed and well-established domestic labour legal framework, stronger domestic political commitment to labour reforms, more stabilized political environment, higher level of labour protection, higher wages, better working conditions and better life, higher productivity and competitiveness of goods and services and more foreign direct investment. Negative effects include potential political risks of state sovereignty weakening, reduction in competitiveness because of rising labour costs and undermined trade and economic growth resulting from trade-based sanctions in labour disputes. Both positive effects and negative effects exist as possibilities and whether they are materialized and which of them outweighs depend on reactions taken by Vietnam. Proposals for Vietnam to benefit from labour commitments include improving the domestic labour law system and efficiency of state administration and enforcement of domestic labour law, changing the economy from factor-based to efficiency-based status, making relevant institutional reforms, introducing the trade-related labour topic into the academic setting, performing studies on the impacts of labour provisions in PTAs, set up strategies and tactics in PTAs’ labour negotiations, joining forces with other trade partners of the same interest, effective exploitation of cooperation mechanisms in PTAs and proposing …",1,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

However, the variety of IoT components, ie, devices, access technologies and applications, which are deployed on the same core infrastructure with a common network policy have led to an unexpected issue of heterogeneity. Such issue directly dismisses the interoperability in the IoT, and hence, significantly decreasing the QoS of a given IoT service. In this paper, we develop a SDN-based framework, called SHIOT to address the above challenge. SHIOT relies on the ontology for examining the end-user requests and applies a SDN controller to classify flow scheduling over the task level. We also utilize the Lagrange relaxation theory to optimize the routing mechanism.

Both private equity and private operating sellers generate lower returns for acquirers than public sellers, but their relative gain differences are not significantly different. In addition, the gain difference cannot be explained by acquirer characteristics, sample selection effects, or means of payments, but it increases with sellers’ director ownership. We examine alternative theories to explain our results.

First, we derive a simple model that highlights the managers’ incentives to overdiversify their firm. In the absence of a takeover threat, managers may structure their firm suboptimally in pursuit of private benefits. However, facing a threat of takeover, managers will de-diversify to maximize firms’ value in fear of being acquired and replaced. We also discuss the discipline role of the takeover market in competitive and non-competitive environment, and its interactions with other monitoring mechanisms. Second, we test three hypotheses generated from the model:(1) state anti-takeover index increases diversification;(2) the disciplinary effect is more pronounced in non-competitive industries;(3) the effect is lower when firms are monitored more intensively. The empirical results are strongly consistent with these predictions, and robust to alternative measurements diversification, and censored and truncated data.",1,9,recognition algorithm routing network detection networks using search multiple problem machine prediction fast software power

In particular, our analysis provides new results for Kleinberg's Small-World model and its extensions. Kleinberg adds a number of directed long-range random links to an nxn lattice network (vertices as nodes of a grid, undirected edges between any two adjacent nodes). Links have a non-uniform distribution that favors arcs to close nodes over more distant ones. He shows that the following phenomenon occurs: between any two nodes a path with expected length O (log 2 n) can be found using a simple greedy algorithm which has no global knowledge of long-range links. We show that Kleinberg's analysis is tight: his algorithm achieves θ (log 2 n) delivery time. Moreover, we show that the expected diameter of the graph is θlog n), a log n factor smaller.

23,29,Distributed hole-bypassing protocol in WSNs with constant stretch and load balancing,"Geographic routing has been widely used in wireless sensor networks because of its simplicity and efficiency resulting from its local and stateless nature. However, when subjected to routing holes (ie, regions without sensor nodes that have communication capability), geographic routing suffers from the so-called local minimum phenomenon, where packets are stopped at the hole boundary. This local minimum phenomenon results in problems of load imbalance (ie, a higher traffic intensity around the hole boundary) and routing path enlargement due to the long hole detour paths. Although several protocols have been proposed to address these issues, the load imbalance problem has not been solved thoroughly, and none of the existing protocols can solve both of these problems.

Also, a significant enlargement on routing path is still possible due to the possibly significant difference between this forbidding area and the hole.

This leads to an increment of the number of wireless interfaces integrated into a single mobile device, hence, it allows the device to be able to connect to multiple access networks. However, in some specific cases such as natural disasters, having an uncorrupted and timely information exchanging means is critical for affected victims to survive or to connect to the outside world. This is because the essential network infrastructures in these cases could be destroyed causing a large number of systems to stop working. In that cases, the victims need a heterogeneous communications network in which they can communicate, without a doubt, by using different wireless access technologies, i.e., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The network must also be able to smoothly change the access technologies, or called a vertical handover, to ensure QoS for ongoing applications.

In this paper, the continuity of real time services as well as energy saving for mobile devices has been taken into account. The conceptual idea is that whenever traffic rate is lower than a threshold it will be smoothly handed over to a low energy consumption technology, i.e., Bluetooth. When the traffic exceeds the limitation of Bluetooth bandwidth, it will be handed over to a wider bandwidth technology, i.e., Wi-Fi. In the considered scenarios, the technologies are not interconnected; hence, the vertical handover management must be fully controlled by the mobile devices.

As a result, the network-wide energy consumption is much higher than the energy consumed by only two end devices. To reduce the network-wide energy consumption, one potential way is to tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption on the intermediate devices.

76,95,FFCDH: Solution to enable face-to-face conversation between deaf and hearing people,"A real time communication between deaf and hearing people is still a barrier that isolates the deaf people from the hearing world. Over ninety percent of deaf children are born to hearing parents. However, most of them can only learn how to communicate using sign language at school. One of the reasons is that the hearings parents have neither enough time nor support to learn sign language to communicate and support their children. Not surprisingly, the deaf finds difficulties in the oral-only education. Since many other hearing pupils do not even know about the existence of sign language, they cannot communicate directly with the deaf without a sign language interpreter. Therefore, to enable a face-to-face conversation between deaf and hearing people, it is important not only to sustain real time conversation between the deaf and their hearing counterparts but also to equip the hearing with basics of sign language. However, speech to sign conversion remains a challenge due to dialectal and sign language variation, speech utterance and lack of sign language written form. In this paper, a solution named Face-to-Face Conversation Deaf and Hearing people—FFCDH is proposed to address above issues. FFCDH supports real time conversation and also allows the hearing to learn the signs with the same meaning as the deaf understand. Moreover, FFCDH records the speech of the hearing and converts it into signs for the deaf. It also provides deaf with an option to adjust volume of their speech by displaying volume of their voice.

The deaf ultimately go to special need schools where they can find a community with common ground and they can use sign language in their daily conversation. The special need schools are either primary or secondary ones, which offer free education to all children. However, special need schools often cannot offer the same broad curriculum as the general schools do. Therefore, in this work, a system that can support the deaf in general education is proposed. The system operates based on the cooperation between smart devices (including mobile devices) and wearable devices. The performance of the system has been validated based on a real test bed. The obtained results show that the system can support the deaf in realtime communication.",15,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

In this paper, we propose a router-aided approach for localizing the P2P traffic hierarchically; it features the insertion of additional delay into each P2P packet based on geographical location of its destination. Compared to the existing approaches that solve the problem on the application layer, our proposed method does not require dedicated servers, cooperation between ISPs and P2P users, or modification of existing P2P application software. Therefore, the proposal can be easily utilized by all types of P2P applications.

It is a challenging task since different takes of the same scene are usually of different lengths; or have been recorded under different environment conditions. A general approach to solve this problem is to decompose the input video sequence into sub-sequences and then group these sub-sequences into clusters. By combining with temporal information, the clustering result is used to find take and scene boundaries. One of the most difficult steps in this approach is to cluster sub-sequences. Most of previous approaches only use one keyframe for representing one sub-sequence and extract features such as color and texture from this keyframe for clustering.

119,145,P2ptv traffic localization by deep packet inspection,"Recently, peer-to-peer has been becoming a promising architecture for developing video streaming services because it can reduce the bottlenecks and the load at the server side. However, P2P systems implement their own routing protocols on overlay networks, which are largely independent of the Internet routing. As a result, the traffic generated by P2P systems is immense and unpredictable. Controlling the P2P traffic is therefore becoming a big challenge for internet service providers (ISPs). Considering the P2P traffic localization is one of the most efficient solutions to optimize the traffic. The existing approaches, however, require several modifications of the application software.

120,146,P2P traffic localization by forcing packet loss,"Recently, peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic is increasing rapidly in volume day by day. One of the main causes is that most of P2P applications including file sharing and streaming applications often form overlay networks for exchanging data that are oblivious to the underlay network topology. As a result, they generate a large amount of inter-domain traffic causing higher cost for Internet service providers (ISPs). This raises a problem of traffic localization. To optimize the cross-ISP/AS traffic, existing approaches focus on solving the problem on the application layer where each P2P application must be equipped with an additional protocol to obtain underlay network information from an “Oracle” server or an additional locality-aware procedure to estimate location by itself. Therefore some modifications of application software are required for these approaches.

121,152,A Router-aided P2P Trafic Localization Method with Bandwidth Limitation,"Recently, peer-to-peer (P2P) systems generate a large amount of unwanted cross-domain traffic on the Internet due to a lack of knowledge about physical network topology. The unwanted cross-domain traffic is especially costly for the internet service providers (ISPs). To reduce the cross-ISP/AS (autonomous system) traffic, the existing approaches introduce network-aware strategies in which a lot of modifications of P2P systems are required. In par-ticular, each P2P application must be modified to integrate with a locality-aware procedure and/or a communication protocol to obtain the topological information from an “oracle” server. In this paper, we propose two schemes for localizing P2P traffic without any peer reaction: (1) fixed-length bandwidth limitation scheme, (2) hierarchical bandwidth limitation scheme. By intentionally limiting the bandwidth of each connection path between peers based on geographical location of the peers destinations, the traffic can be localized with single level for the first scheme and with multiple levels for the second scheme. Compared to the existing locality-enhancing approaches,our two schemes require neither dedicated servers, nor cooperation between ISPs and users, nor any modification of existing P2P application software. Therefore, we believe that all types of P2P applications can easily utilize our proposals. Experiments on P2P streaming applications indicate that the fixed-length bandwidth limitation scheme successfully realizes P2P traffic localization.

Thus, P2P video streaming applications (P2PTV) such as PPStream [1], SopCast [2], and PPTV [3] have been getting more and more popular. In P2P systems, the transmission load is shifted from the server side to the network side, and therefore, the bottlenecks can be reduced. However, controlling the traffic generated by P2P systems becomes more challenging for internet service providers (ISPs) as well as research community. The main cause is that most of P2P applications are bandwidth hungry; they form overlay networks and establish connections based on not the network stability, but the resource availability.

We then investigate a routing mechanism for these multiple CHs to send data to the base station (BS) using common optimal route. Furthermore, in order to increase fault tolerance of WSNs, in our routing protocol, a sensor node needs satisfying required energy to become or remain as a CH.

149,197,Multipath routing for cluster-based and event-based protocols in wireless sensor networks.,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that consists of a large number of small sensing self-powered nodes is a promising approach for a variety of applications. Possible applications of WSN are of interest to the most diverse fields: environmental monitoring, warfare, child education, surveillance, micro-surgery and agriculture are only few examples. Due to limited power of sensor nodes that are distributed in a large geographical area, the WSN requires robust but simple, scalable, energy-efficient and also self-configurable routing algorithms. From these characteristics, WSN routing protocol can coarsely be classified in two main classes: flat and hierarchical approaches. Hierarchical solution (also called cluster-based) separates nodes in clusters and the communication within clusters is possible only through the selected leaders or Cluster Head-CH. In the reality, it is not always necessary to divide all the network to clusters because one event can only appear in a small part. In this case, routing protocol needs to form only one cluster with one CH for minimizing the amount of data sending to the base station (BS). Some such routing approaches (called cluster-based and event-based) are proposed as ARPEES [1], OEDSR [2], HPEQ[3]... but they all create only one optimal route from CH to the BS and this route can be broken when the sensor node's power is negligible. In this paper, we propose two multipath solutions called Multiparth ARPEES (MARPEES) and Energy Aware Mesh Routing Protocol (EMRP) for ensuring reliable and fault-tolerance data transmission while balancing node's energy consumption in the network and minimizing the control overhead.

The fundamental sub-problem of barrier coverage in WSNs is the minimal exposure path (MEP) problem. The MEP refers to the worst-case coverage path where an intruder can move through the sensing field with the lowest capability to be detected. Knowledge about MEP is useful for network designers to identify the worst coverage in WSNs. Most prior research focused on this problem with the assumption that the WSN has an ideal deployment environment without obstacles, causing existing gaps between theoretical and practical WSNs systems. To overcome this drawback, we investigate a systematic and generic MEP problem under real-world environment networks by presenting obstacles called Obstacle-Evasion-MEP (hereinafter OE-MEP). We propose an algorithm to create several types of arbitrary-shaped obstacles inside the deployment area of WSNs. The OE-MEP problem is an NP-Hard with high dimension, non-differentiation, non-linearity, and constraints. Based upon its characteristics, we then devise an elite algorithm namely Family System based Evolutionary Algorithm (FEA) with our newly-proposed concepts of Family System, tailored to efficiently solve the OE-MEP. We also build an extension to a custom-made simulation environment to integrate a variety of network topologies as well as obstacles. Experimental results on numerous instances indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the converted OE-MEP problem and performs better in solution accuracy than existing approaches.",5,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

152,200,Improved Compact Routing Schemes for Random Interconnects.,"Random topology has been an increasingly favorable approach for designing interconnection networks, as it can provide a combination of low latency and incremental network growth that could not be provided by the traditional rigid topologies. However, the common shortest-path routing in a random interconnect poses a scalability problem, for it requires global network info to make routing decisions and so, the routing table size (RTS) can be very large. Therefore, this manuscript would aim to revisit the well-known research area of landmark-based compact routing and to improve the universal routing schemes for the specific case of random interconnects. It would propose new landmark-based compact routing schemes, using 2 heuristic techniques to select landmarks that are evenly spaced, which would reduce the RTS in the well-known Thorup and Zwick's scheme by up to 18% and produce a shorter average path length.",5,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

Particularly, it is necessary to reduce the routing table size (RTS) as much as possible while maintaining other performance factors in a good state. Based on a new landmark selection technique, we propose our Geographic Landmark-based Compact Routing scheme which can reduce the RTS from the well-known Thorup and Zwick's scheme by roughly 15% for a network of 1024 nodes and roughly 45% for a network of at least 100K nodes, and which also produces shorter avcrago path length.",5,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

In this study, we propose a new mechanism, including new data structures and algorithms, that allow the detection and filtering of large amounts of attack packets (Web request) based on monitoring and capturing the suspect groups of source IPs that can be sending packets at similar patterns, i.e. with very high and similar frequencies.

Our proposed approach is to partition the graph by a graph Voronoi diagram where the Voronoi nodes, considered as landmarks, are carefully selected in some special manner for achieving the mentioned targets. We also introduce a direct application for this problem, namely navigating with limited resources, where one would like to produce an inexpensive navigation device that is although short of battery and of limited memory but still is capable to help showing directions in a long hiking journey in the wilderness. This is achieved by using a specialized map (for navigating) created based on our proposed graph partitioning. We introduce two different heuristic techniques in selecting the landmarks in such a mentioned desired manner. Initial experiments with our proposed algorithms show encouraging results where we can successfully construct a 0.5-balanced partition for all tested graphs.",5,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
156,204,Distributed Shortcut Networks: Low-Latency Low-Degree Non-Random Topologies Targeting the Diameter and Cable Length Trade-Off.,"Low communication latency becomes a main concern in highly parallel computers and supercomputers that reach millions of processing cores. Random network topologies are better suited to achieve low average shortest path length and low diameter in terms of the hop counts between nodes. However, random topologies lead to two problems: (1) increased aggregate cable length on a machine room floor that would become dominant for communication latency in next-generation custom supercomputers, and (2) high routing complexity that typically requires a routing table at each node (e.g., topology-agnostic deadlock-free routing). In this context, we first propose low-degree non-random topologies that exploit the small-world effect, which has been well modeled by some random network models. Our main idea is to carefully design a set of various-length shortcuts that keep the diameter small while maintaining a short cable length for economical passive electric cables. We also propose custom routing that uses the regularity of the various-length shortcuts. Our experimental graph analyses show that our proposed topology has low diameter and low average shortest path length, which are considerably better than those of the counterpart 3-D torus and are near to those of a random topology with the same average degree. The proposed topology has average cable length drastically shorter than that of the counterpart random topology, which leads to low cost of interconnection networks. Our custom routing takes non-minimal paths to provide lower zero-load latency than the minimal custom routings on different counterpart topologies. Our discrete-event simulation results using SimGrid show that our proposed topology is suitable for applications that have irregular communication patterns or non-nearest neighbor collective communication patterns.",5,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
157,205,An Efficient Compact Routing Scheme for Interconnection Topologies based on the Random Model.,"The field of interconnection network has recently observed a resurgent interest that are fueled by modern ICT technologies wherein traditional topologies have been found less desirable. The recent approach using the random network model has been considered a good answer to new challenges but also has a limitation in routing scalability, i.e. the routing table size (RTS) can become very large which is not affordable by market commodity switches. We propose to design new routing schemes especially designed for the random network model that can improve this situation. As a major contribution, we propose a new compact routing scheme named by CORRA which exploits the random model properties that help to achieve near optimum route length while keeps the routing table size small enough. In general, our new routing algorithm can achieve average route length only a bit longer than in using the shortest path routing. The RTS achieved by CORRA is very small as expected, e.g. 520 for network size 8192, which is small enough to allow network size even up to millions of nodes.",5,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
158,206,FDDA: A Framework For Fast Detecting Source Attack In Web Application DDoS Attack.,"Anomaly detection techniques usually require a training phase in order to capture the normality traits (typical features) of a given system which is considered as in a state free of attack. The efficiency of detecting abnormal signals mainly depends on processing time and the quality of featured data learned from the training phase. In this research, we propose a framework for fast detecting DDoS attack (FDDA) which can improve the speed and efficiency in detecting an on-going DDoS attack to web application, and hence greatly reduce the training time. Our main idea is based on using an on-line scanning process where our detection algorithm looks for certain traits of DDoS attack using some specially designed techniques, which if occur then the algorithm rapidly builds a blacklist of requests and suspicious IPs that will be used in the filtering process in the next stage. The mentioned blacklist can be gradually updated during the whole process. The techniques for detecting traits of attack are developed based on some special criteria, which have been observed from the natural behaviors of the request sent from the attacking botnet. We believe that, even aware of these techniques, smart hackers will still find it very hard to escape from making these traits of behaviors.",5,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

In this context we propose a low-degree topology and its floor layout in which a cabinet or node set can be newly inserted by connecting short cables to a single existing cabinet. Our graph analysis shows that the proposed topology has low diameter, low average shortest path length and short average cable length comparable to existing topologies with the same degree. When incrementally adding nodes and cabinets to the proposed topology, its diameter and average shortest path length increase modestly. Our discrete-event simulation results show that the proposed topology provides a comparable performance to 2-D Torus for some parallel applications. The network cost and power consumption of DSN-F modestly increase when compared to the counterpart non-random topologies.",5,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
160,208,A Distributed Algorithm For Monitoring An Expanding Hole In Wireless Sensor Networks.,"Holes in sensor networks are regions that have no operating nodes and that may occur due to several reasons, including cases caused by natural obstacles or disaster suffered areas. Determining the location and shape of holes can help to monitor these disasters (such as volcano, tsunami, etc.) or help to make smart, early routing decisions for circumventing a hole. There are many hole determination algorithms proposed in the literature, however, these only consider the networks with static holes i.e. with stable boundary nodes. Moreover, most of these are designed in a centralized manner which is not suitable to the unstable situation of networks with an expanding hole. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme not only for determining the initial shape but also for monitoring and quickly reporting about the area of a hole gradually expanding. Our algorithms are designed in a distributed manner and our initial simulation results show that our protocol is lightweight and feasible with monitoring sensor networks with an expanding hole.

Recently proposed random network topologies achieve low latency, but they require each switch to have a large number of routing table entries, e.g., larger than N for an N-node network, for implementing a minimal routing. In this study, we propose the use of a random network topology with our new routing scheme so that the required routing table size becomes small, e.g., 528 for 8192 nodes, at each switch. Our main finding is that our routing algorithm cannot always follow the minimal paths, but its average path length is still short when compared to that of existing network topologies.",5,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

The current protocols on finding the patching locations always require re-running the protocols from scratch many times. This constraint causes the time complexity and energy overhead to increase proportionally to the hole size. In this paper, we propose a lightweight protocol to determine coverage holes in wireless sensor network. Our protocol does not only can determine the exact hole boundary but also approximate the boundary by a simpler shape which can help to speed up the patching location finding process. The simulation experiments show that our protocol can reduce more than 56% of time complexity and save more than 46% of energy overhead in comparison with existing protocols.",5,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Moreover, most of these protocols are conducted in a centralized manner which is not suitable with the resource constraint of sensor nodes.

We follow the design principles of Distributed Shortcut Networks (DSN), which construct non-random topologies with the creation of long-range shortcuts inspired by observations in small-world networks. However, we focus on designing a powerful custom routing mechanism which smartly exploits some precious properties of the topology. As a result, our new DSN-a network with a carefully refined routing logic performs significantly better than the basic DSN in term of communication latency while provides strengths in fault-tolerance as well as load-balance. These help the network become robust against link failures or burst of traffic demand while topology-agnostic deadlock-free routing (e.g. the famous up*/down* algorithm) suffers a lot.",5,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

However, a finer approximation (for smaller stretch) leads to higher cost of dissemination, which could be unaffordable for the sensors. We provide an insightful analysis to this fundamental trade-off of the hole approximation problem, using a geometric model. Based on this we discuss an efficient approximation-dissemination scheme using a natural, heuristic approximation technique. For reasonable conditions (network is dense enough apart from the hole), we assure that the routing stretch is under a predefined threshold > 1 while the dissemination cost is also under tight control. Our initial experiment results also confirm that our approach is significantly more efficient and economical, compared to existing proposals.",5,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Our network model is between 3 parties, the game producer, the game distributor and the game player (client), where we aim to support the distributor to fight against cheater clients with minimum cooperation from the game producer. Our protection system is centered on our specifically designed module, GameGuard, which accomplishes the main protection duties while simultaneously, interacts with the GameClient program so that if a serious hack attempt is detected, both will terminate. Our two layers of protection, in hiding game modules and detecting hacks, integrated with the mechanism of auto-updating/reporting with the distributor server provide a general, powerful yet flexible approach in building hack protection products. We support the game distributors with a general protection framework which is not dependent of specific games and also only need minimum cooperation from the distant game producers. Our approach is powerful enough that we would defeat most kinds of attacks which are based on hooking Windows APIs, including ones from memory, graphic or hardware attack categories. Our GameGuard system is also robust against attacks directed at the protection modules: we achieve authenticity of our protection modules based on the authenticity of the GameClient assured by the producer. Based on our framework, we have implemented a hack protection system which is being extensively experimented at VTC, the Vietnam Multimedia Corporation, with very encouraging results.",5,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

It is not denied that various approaches bring benefits for visitors in supporting them of searching tourist attractions, such us interested places for the visit, eating or staying. However, like a coin has two sides, too much information would be the difficulty for people when planning their journeys. Generally, tourists usually have problems when finding a satisfied accommodation without a reference to nearby restaurants, sights or event locations. In addition, travelers suffer from the information overload when they look for information about potential destinations, events and related services. Providing the relevant and up-to-date information for the tourists with different personal interests is still a challenging task for the tourist guide information systems. This paper presents a semantic web approach for developing STAAR (Semantic Tourist informAtion Access and Recommending) which is a system that addresses the above mentioned issues. Specifically, it is described how an ontology is designed to represent the travel related information, and to support the integrating data from the open repositories. Relying on this ontology, we propose an algorithm for generating travel itinerary on the Web which is relevant to both criterions of the itinerary length and user interest.",6,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

To exploit the correlation in WSNs, the correlation model is required. However, most of the present correlation models are linear and distance-dependent. This paper proposes a general distance-independent entropy correlation model based on the relation between joint entropy and the number of members in a group. This relation is estimated using entropy of individual members and entropy correlation coefficients of member pairs. The proposed model is then applied to evaluate two data aggregation schemes in WSNs including data compression and representative schemes. In the data compression scheme, some main routing strategies are compared and evaluated to find the most appropriate strategy. In the representative scheme, with the desired distortion requirement, a method to calculate the number of representative nodes and the selection of these nodes are proposed. The practical validations showed the effectiveness of the proposed correlation model and data reduction schemes.

One approach is based on the characteristics of environment -- the correlation among sensed data of nodes in a region. The sensor nodes are clustered into highly correlated regions (HCRs) to take advantage of correlation between sensor nodes in order to save energy. However, the determination of HCR is very complex in calculation, thus causes difficulty in implementation. This paper proposes a correlation-based approach that evaluates the correlation between two data sets using a simple calculation and that guarantees the accuracy in correlated evaluation between data. This correlation-based method is proposed to cluster sensor nodes into HCRs. Because of highly correlated characteristics among sensed data of nodes in the same HCRs, some high correlated-nodes would be inactive for energy saving.

This is achieved by precoding to mitigate mutual interference. The combinatorial optimization structure requires an extremely high cost to obtain the global optimum even with a reduced number of users.

This paper focuses on MB-HTS systems where all beams reuse the same spectrum. In particular, we propose a novel user scheduling and power allocation design capable of providing guarantees in terms of the individual QoS requirements while maximizing the system throughput under a limited power budget. Precoding is employed in the forward link to mitigate mutual interference at the users in multiple-access scenarios over different coherence time intervals. The combinatorial optimization structure from user scheduling requires an extremely high cost to obtain the global optimum even when a reduced number of users fit into a time slot. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm yielding good trade-off between performance and computational complexity, applicable to a static operation framework of geostationary (GEO) satellite networks. Although the power allocation optimization is signomial programming, non-convex on a standard form, the solution can be lower bounded by the global optimum of a geometric program with a hidden convex structure. A local solution to the joint user scheduling and power allocation problem is consequently obtained by a successive optimization approach.

However, these new characteristics also cost GNSS receivers a high computational complexity. Due to their attractive acquisition time performance, matched filter (MF) correlators promise to be a good choice for GNSS signal acquisition engines. Existing methods to evaluate GNSS signal acquisition engine performance parameters, viz. detection probabilities and mean acquisition time, assume that the detections among the neighboring test cells are independent. However in a matched filter correlator, depending on the spacing between the test cells, due to the correlation of the local code with the noise component in the received signal at different time instances within a chip period, there can exist strong correlations, which affect these performance parameters. Also, the presence of cell correlations influences the acquisition threshold setting, which is a critical design parameter. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the significance of the cell-correlation phenomenon in MF correlators for the two widely used signal families in GNSS, namely BPSK and BOC, in particular BPSK(1) and BOC(1,1). Justifying the theoretical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that the maximum error in estimating the mean acquisition time without considering the cell-correlation phenomenon is shown to be about 10% for the BPSK(1) and about 12% for the BOC(1,1) signal.",8,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

Stemming from the fact that using a full code period (CM or CL) for signal acquisition in GPS L2C receivers might not be necessary in normal situations (e.g. outdoor, light indoor, etc.), in this paper, we introduce a partial acquisition architecture using specially-designed matched filters (MFs) in order to relieve the computational complexity of the acquisition stage. The partial correlation loss is compensated by differential postcorrelation techniques. Three techniques, namely conventional differential combination (CDC), generalized differential combination (GDC), and modified generalized differential combination (MGDC), are investigated in terms of detection probabilities and mean acquisition time leading to the selection of MGDC as the most suitable technique for the L2C partial acquisition. By using this technique, a 2-dB sensitivity improvement with respect to the conventional noncoherent combination and a 94.5% reduction in mean acquisition time in comparison with the full code acquisition are shown for 1-ms partial correlation",8,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

To overcome this limitation, Lin and Cohen proposed the power iteration clustering (PIC) technique (Lin and Cohen in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 655–662, 2010), which is a simple and fast version of SC. Instead of finding the eigenvectors, PIC finds only one pseudo-eigenvector, which is a linear combination of the eigenvectors in linear time. However, in certain critical situations, using only one pseudo-eigenvector is not enough for clustering because of the inter-class collision problem. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the deflation technique to compute multiple orthogonal pseudo-eigenvectors (orthogonality is used to avoid redundancy). Our method is more accurate than PIC but has the same computational complexity.

185,235,A Fast Implementation of Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields.,"Recently, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model has been used and proved to be a good model for sequential modeling. It, however, lacks the capability of duration modeling. Therefore, some researchers introduced semi Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRF) to take into account the duration distribution and showed some improvements. Nevertheless, the training algorithms for semi-CRF require quite a high complexity making semi-CRF impractical in some large-scale problems. Therefore, in this work we propose a fast implementation of the training algorithm in order to reduce the complexity required by semi-CRF. Our theoretical analysis as well as experiments’ result show a noticeable improvement in computation time, which is about ten times less than that of the original algorithm.",9,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system 
186,236,Emotional speech classification using hidden conditional random fields.,"Although there have been a great number of papers in the area of emotional speech recognition, most of them contribute to the feature extraction phase. Regarding classification algorithm, hidden Markov model (HMM) is still the most commonly used method. Whereas HMM was pointed out to be less accurate than its discriminative counterpart, the hidden conditional random fields (HCRF) model, for example in phone classification or gesture recognition. Therefore in this study, we investigate the use of the HCRF model in emotional speech classification problem. In our experiments, we extracted Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features from the well-known Berlin emotional speech dataset (EMO) and eNTERFACE 2005 dataset. After that, we used the 10-fold cross validation rule to train, evaluate and compare our result with that of HMM. The experiments show that HCRF achieves significant improvement (p-value ≤ 0.05) in classification accuracy. In addition, we speed up the training phase of the model by caching the gradient computation. Therefore our computation time is much less than that of the existing methods.",9,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

190,241,Magnetoelectric Vortex Magnetic Field Sensors Based on the Metglas/PZT Laminates.,"This paper describes the route, from simulations toward experiments, for optimizing the magnetoelectric (ME) geometries for vortex magnetic field sensors. The research is performed on the base of the Metglas/Piezoelectric (PZT) laminates in both open and closed magnetic circuit (OMC and CMC) geometries with different widths (W), lengths (L), and diameters (D). Among these geometries, the CMC laminates demonstrate advantages not only in their magnetic flux distribution, but also in their sensitivity and in their independence of the position of the vortex center. In addition, the ME voltage signal is found to be enhanced by increasing the magnetostrictive volume fraction. Optimal issues are incorporated to realize a CMC-based ME double sandwich current sensor in the ring shape with D × W = 6 mm × 1.5 mm and four layers of Metglas. At the resonant frequency of 174.4 kHz, this sensor exhibits the record sensitivity of 5.426 V/A as compared to variety of devices such as the CMC ME sensor family, fluxgate, magnetoresistive, and Hall-effect-based devices. It opens a potential to commercialize a new generation of ME-based current and (or) vortex magnetic sensors.

In this paper, we present an approach using modern multi-core graphic processing units (GPUs) as computing devices for finding lost passwords of ZIP archives. The combination of GPU's extremely high computing power and the state-of-the-art password structure analysis methods would bring us a feasible solution for recovering ZIP file password. We first apply password generation rules[9] in generating a reasonable password space, and then use GPUs for exhaustively verifying every password in the space. The experimental results have shown that the password verification speed increases about from 48 to 170 times (depends on the number of GPUs) compared to sequential execution on the Intel Core 2 Quad Q8400 2.66 Ghz.

195,246,Auto-Updating Portable Application Model of Multi-Cloud Marketplace Through Bidirectional Transformations System.,"At present, the cloud marketplace becomes more and more widely used for delivering cloud applications to consumers. The diversity of IaaS and PaaS services from many cloud providers gives customers many choices that benefit them the most. If a customer is not satisfied with his existing cloud resource service (IaaS or PaaS), he is going to stop using the service in use and consider other cloud service providers. And he also wants his cloud software bought on the market to be hosted on new cloud platforms. However, changing cloud resource services for multi-cloud application is not trivial. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses a Composable Application Model (CAM) to construct the topology of a multi-cloud application in a Blueprint. Thereby, all the changes of cloud platform services are reflected to the Blueprint. In this way, the cloud application is managed. Thus, cloud application operation is guaranteed after one or several of its software components are re-deployed on new cloud platform services and re-established application interconnections so that the operation of the cloud application is as an initial state. For updating the Blueprint, we built a bidirectional transformation system where the core is a bidirectional transformation program.

Because of the enormous size of data and the dynamic nature of World Wide Web, this computation is generally executed on large web graphs (to billions webpages) and requires refreshing quite often, so it becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for computing PageRank score -- a Google ranking method based on analyzing the link structure of the Web on graphics processing units (GPUs). We have employed a slightly modification of a storage data format called binary 'link structure file' which inspirited from [2] for storing the web graph data.

197,248,Compiling ML polymorphism with explicit layout bitmap.,"Most of the current implementations of functional languages adopt so-called ""tagged data representations"" to support tracing garbage collection. The representations impose a burden of data conversion on the runtime performance and the interoperability between ML and other languages. In this paper, we present a type-directed compilation method for ML polymorphism that supports natural representations of integers and other atomic data.This is achieved by compiling ML so that each runtime object (a heap block or a stack frame) has a ""bitmap"" that describes the pointer positions in the block. Since a polymorphic function may produce runtime objects of different types, the compiler needs to compute appropriate bitmaps for each instantiation of the function. This would require us to insert extra lambda abstractions and applications to pass the bits required in bitmap calculations. This compilation process should be done for both stack frames and heap-allocated objects including functions' closures and their environment records. We solve these problems by combining the type-directed compilation method with typed closure conversion, and type-preserving A-normalizationThe resulting compilation process is shown to be sound with respect to an untyped operational semantics with bitmap-inspecting garbage collection. The proposed compilation method has been implemented for the full Standard ML Language, demonstrating its practical feasibility.",10,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method 
198,249,Improvement of K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm for Network Intrusion Detection Using Shannon-Entropy.,"Non-parametric Nearest Neighbor is an algorithm seeking for the closest data points based on the Euclidean Norm (the standard distance between two data points in a multidimensional space). The classical K-nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm applies this theory to find K data points in a vicinity of the considering data, then uses majority voting to label its category. This paper proposes a modification to the original KNN to improve its accuracy by changing that Euclidean Norm based on Shannon-Entropy theory in the context of Network Intrusion Detecton System. Shannon-Entropy calculates the importance of features based on the labels of those data points, then the distance between data points would be re-calculated through the new weights found for these features. Therefore, it is possible to find the more suitable K data points nearby. NSL - KDD dataset is used in this paper to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. A comparison is drawn between the results of the classic KNN, related work on its improvement and the proposed algorithm as well as novel deep learning approaches to evaluate its effectivenes in different scenarios. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm shows good performance on NSL - KDD data set. Specifically, an accuracy up to 99.73% detecting DoS attacks is obtained, 5.46% higher than the original KNN, and 1.15% higher than the related work of M-KNN. Recalculating the Euclidean-Norm distance retains the contribution of the features with low importance to the data classification, while assuring that features with higher importance will have a higher impact. Thus, the proposal does not raise any concern for losing information, and even achieves high efficiency in the classification of features and data classification.",11,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

It has been observed that few studies have been devoted to predicting future radar echo images in a reasonable time using the deep learning approach. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, RainPredRNN, which is the combination of the UNet segmentation model and the PredRNN_v2 deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting with weather radar echo images. By leveraging the abilities of the contracting-expansive path of the UNet model, the number of calculated operations of the RainPredRNN model is significantly reduced. This result consequently offers the benefit of reducing the processing time of the overall model while maintaining reasonable errors in the predicted images. In order to validate the proposed model, we performed experiments on real reflectivity fields collected from the Phadin weather radar station, located at Dien Bien province in Vietnam. Some credible quality metrics, such as the mean absolute error (MAE), the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and the critical success index (CSI), were used for analyzing the performance of the model.

205,258,A New Complex Fuzzy Inference System With Fuzzy Knowledge Graph and Extensions in Decision Making.,"Context and Background:Complex fuzzy theory has a strong practical implication in many real-world applications. Complex Fuzzy Inference System (CFIS) is a powerful technique to overcome the challenges of uncertain, periodic data. However, a question is raised for CFIS: How can we deduce and predict the result in case there is little knowledge about data information and rule base? This is significance because many real applications do not have enough knowledge of rule base for inference so that the performance of systems may be low. Thus, it is necessary to have an approximate reasoning method to represent and derive final results. Motivation: Recently, the Mamdani Complex Fuzzy Inference System (M-CFIS) has been proposed with a specific inference mechanism according to the Mamdani type. A new improvement so-called the Mamdani Complex Fuzzy Inference System with Rule Reduction (M-CFIS-R) has been designed to utilize granular computing with complex similarity measures to reduce the rule base so as to gain better performance in decision-making problems. However in M-CFIS-R, testing data are checked by matching with each rule in the rule base, which leads to a high cost of computational time. Besides, if the testing data contain records that are not inferred by the rule base, the output cannot be generated. This happens in real commerce systems in which the rule base is small at the time of creation and needs to feed with new rules. Methodology: In order to handle those issues, this article first time proposes the Fuzzy Knowledge Graph to represent the rule base in terms of linguistic labels and their relationships according to the rule set. An adjacent matrix of Fuzzy Knowledge Graph is generated for inference. When a record in the Testing dataset is given, it would be fuzzified and labelled. Each component in the record is checked with the Fuzzy Knowledge Graph by the inference mechanism in approximate reasoning called Fast Inference Search Algorithm. Then, we derive .",12,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Machine learning methods are often opted for prediction in HCA. In this paper, we propose a new method for HCA that uses genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN). Operators of GA are used to boost up calculation to get optimal weights in the forward propagation of ANN. Experiments on a real database of Hanoi Medical University Hospital (HMUH) including calculus of kidney and ureter inpatients show that the new method achieves better accuracy than the relevant ones including linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), ANN and deep learning.

However, traditional monitoring requires field works or surveys performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and sparse. Agriculture monitoring systems are looking for sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing on satellite data for cheap and timely paddy mapping. The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from low-Earth orbiting satellites, to differentiate crop areas from non-crop areas.

219,272,An Ensemble System with Random Projection and Dynamic Ensemble Selection.,"In this paper, we propose using dynamic ensemble selection (DES) method on ensemble generated based on random projection. We first construct the homogeneous ensemble in which a set of base classifier is obtained by a learning algorithm on different training schemes generated by projecting the original training set to lower dimensional down spaces. We then develop a DES method on those base classifiers so that a subset of base classifiers is selected to predict label for each test sample. Here competence of a classifier is evaluated based on its prediction results on the test sample’s k - nearest neighbors obtaining from the projected data of validation set. Our proposed method, therefore, gains the benefits not only from the random projection in dimensionality reduction and diverse training schemes generation but also from DES method in choosing an appropriate subset of base classifiers for each test sample. The experiments conducted on some datasets selected from four different sources indicate that our framework is better than many state-of-the-art DES methods concerning to classification accuracy.",14,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

222,289,Human behavior analysis by means of multimodal context mining,"There is sufficient evidence proving the impact that negative lifestyle choices have on people’s health and wellness. Changing unhealthy behaviours requires raising people’s self-awareness and also providing healthcare experts with a thorough and continuous description of the user’s conduct. Several monitoring techniques have been proposed in the past to track users’ behaviour; however, these approaches are either subjective and prone to misreporting, such as questionnaires, or only focus on a specific component of context, such as activity counters. This work presents an innovative multimodal context mining framework to inspect and infer human behaviour in a more holistic fashion. The proposed approach extends beyond the state-of-the-art, since it not only explores a sole type of context, but also combines diverse levels of context in an integral manner. Namely, low-level contexts, including activities, emotions and locations, are identified from heterogeneous sensory data through machine learning techniques. Low-level contexts are combined using ontological mechanisms to derive a more abstract representation of the user’s context, here referred to as high-level context. An initial implementation of the proposed framework supporting real-time context identification is also presented. The developed system is evaluated for various realistic scenarios making use of a novel multimodal context open dataset and data on-the-go, demonstrating prominent context-aware capabilities at both low and high levels.",28,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

229,297,RL-TSCH: A Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Radio Scheduling in TSCH 802.15.4e.,"In order to apply Internet of Things technologies into real world, the low-power low-cost protocol stack CoAP/UDP/IPv6/RPL/6LoWPAN/802.15.4-802.15.4e is a good solution and appropriate to low-power low-cost applications. The standard IEEE 802.15.4e utilizes scheduled-based multiple access approach in this, at the beginning of each time slot, the nodes will always turn on the radio for a specified period of time to check if packets are sent or not and the process is repeated in the next time slot (Minimal Scheduling Algorithm). Thus, it leads to unnecessary waste of energy if for a while the node does not transmit or send a packet. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose in this paper a reinforcement learning solution, called RL-TSCH for scheduling nodes (controlling the node's radio on or off) of TSCH 802.15.4e based on Markov Decision Process associated with Q-Learning algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our RL-TSCH algorithm and compare with Minimal Scheduling Algorithm in simulation and real testbed with Contiki operating system.

230,298,esVHO: Energy Saving Vertical Handover Extension for Local SDN in Non-Interconnected Environment.,"Wireless technologies that offer high data rate are generally energy-consuming ones while low-energy technologies commonly provide low data rate. Both kinds of technologies have been integrated in a single mobile device for different services. Therefore, if the service does not always require high data rate, the low energy technology, i.e., Bluetooth, can be used instead of the energy-consuming one, i.e., Wi-Fi, for saving energy. It is obvious that energy savings are maximized by turning the unused technology off. However, when active sessions of ongoing services migrate between different technologies, the network-layer connectivity must be maintained, or a vertical handover (VHO) between different networks is required. Moreover, when the networks are not interconnected, the VHO must be fully controlled by the device itself. The device typically navigates traffic through the firmware of the wireless network interface cards (WNIC) using their drivers, which are dependent on the vendors. To control the traffic navigation between WNICs without any modification of the WNICs' drivers, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can be applied locally on the mobile device, the so called local SDN. In the local SDN architecture, a local SDN controller (SDNC) is used to control a virtual OpenFlow switch, which turns WNICs into its switch ports. Although the SDNC can navigate the traffic, it lacks the global view of the network topology. Hence, to correctly navigate traffic in a VHO process, an extended SDN controller (extSDNC) was proposed in a previous work. With the extSDNC, the SDNC can perform VHO based on a link layer trigger but with a significant packet loss rate. Therefore, in this paper, a framework named esVHO is proposed that executes VHO at the network layer to reduce the packet loss rate and reduce energy consumption. Experiments on VHO performance prove that esVHO can reduce the packet loss rate considerably. Moreover, the results of an energy saving experiment show that esVHO performs high energy saving up to 4.89 times compared to the others.",15,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

The comparison of two LA implementations has been conducted in a real testbed under the UDP and TCP traffic loads. The testbed includes Pica8 P-3925 switches, which support two modes: an OpenFlow switch (i.e., using Open vSwitch) and a conventional switch (i.e., using the operating system called XorPlus). The evaluation results show that two LA implementations achieve similar performance in improving throughput. However, the XorPlus implementation provides a better resilience than the other. Specifically, the LA implementation on XorPlus spends less than 1.49538 seconds to switch the TCP traffic on the faulty link to the other links of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) while the switchover time is four times longer on the Open vSwitch. In the case of UDP traffic, the maximum switchover time on the Open vSwitch is twice the one on XorPlus.",15,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system 
232,301,A bi-level optimized charging algorithm for energy depletion avoidance in wireless rechargeable sensor networks.,"In Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs), charging scheme optimization is one of the most critical issues, which plays an essential role in deciding the sensors’ lifetime. An effective charging scheme should simultaneously consider both the charging path and the charging time. Existing works, however, mainly focus on determining the optimal charging path and adopt the full charging strategy. The full charging approach may increase the sensors’ charging delay and eventually lead to sensor energy depletion. This paper studies how to optimize the charging path and the charging time at the same time to avoid energy depletion in WRSNs. We first formulate the investigated problem with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. We then leverage the bi-level optimization approach and represent the targeted problem with two levels: the charging path optimization at the upper level and the charging time optimization at the lower level. A combination of Genetic Algorithm and Greedy method is proposed to determine the optimal charging path. Besides, to reduce the computational complexity of charging time identification level, we propose a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the charging time of the best charging path in each evolutionary generation. The experimental validation on various network scenarios demonstrates our proposed charging scheme’s superiority over the existing algorithms.",17,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
233,302,Multi-objective teaching-learning evolutionary algorithm for enhancing sensor network coverage and lifetime.,"Coverage plays a vital role in the performance and proper functioning of wireless sensor networks. However, ensuring a network’s coverage is met numerous challenges due to sensors having limited sensing range, communication range, and energy. Many coverage problems are NP-hard, one of which is the network coverage with lifetime problem (CTLP). As such, a number of meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve CTLP in practical scenarios. This paper proposes an approach for CTLP based on the teaching–learning based optimization algorithm (TLBO), which is often employed to address continuous optimization problems. Specifically, a discrete version of multi-objective improved teaching–learning based optimization algorithm (MO-ITLBO) called HTLBO is proposed, employing genetic operators inspired by evolutionary computing methods. Experimental results are extensively compared to those obtained from previous approaches, namely MO-ITLBO, fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), multi-objective differential evolution (MODE), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D).

234,303,A family system based evolutionary algorithm for obstacle-evasion minimal exposure path problem in Internet of Things.,"Barrier coverage in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is a well-known model for military security applications in IoTs, in which sensors are deployed to detect every movement over the predefined border. The fundamental sub-problem of barrier coverage in WSNs is the minimal exposure path (MEP) problem. The MEP refers to the worst-case coverage path where an intruder can move through the sensing field with the lowest capability to be detected. Knowledge about MEP is useful for network designers to identify the worst coverage in WSNs. Most prior research focused on this problem with the assumption that the WSN has an ideal deployment environment without obstacles, causing existing gaps between theoretical and practical WSNs systems. To overcome this drawback, we investigate a systematic and generic MEP problem under real-world environment networks by presenting obstacles called Obstacle-Evasion-MEP (hereinafter OE-MEP). We propose an algorithm to create several types of arbitrary-shaped obstacles inside the deployment area of WSNs. The OE-MEP problem is an NP-Hard with high dimension, non-differentiation, non-linearity, and constraints. Based upon its characteristics, we then devise an elite algorithm namely Family System based Evolutionary Algorithm (FEA) with our newly-proposed concepts of Family System, tailored to efficiently solve the OE-MEP. We also build an extension to a custom-made simulation environment to integrate a variety of network topologies as well as obstacles. Experimental results on numerous instances indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for the converted OE-MEP problem and performs better in solution accuracy than existing approaches.",17,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
235,304,Two levels approach based on multifactorial optimization to solve the clustered shortest path tree problem.,"The Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem (CluSPT) has a great meaning in theoretical research as well as a wide range of applications in everyday life, especially in the field of network optimization. Being able to solve the CluSPT will path the way for improving practical systems such as agricultural irrigation and product distribution. Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) is a variant of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) aiming at simultaneously solving multiple factorial tasks which can be diverse in types, dimensionalities and search spaces. The applications of MFEA have yet to be fully exploited, but the realm has recently attracted much interest from the research community, especially those who are working on evolutionary multitasking. Considering these characteristics, this paper describes a new approach using the MFEA for solving the CluSPT. The MFEA has two tasks: the first is solving the CluSPT problem and the second is solving a new problem which is decomposed from the CluSPT problem. The goal of the first task is finding the fittest solution as possible for the CluSPT while the goal of the second task is determining the best tree (w.r.t. cost minimization) which envelops all vertices of the problem. This paper also introduces mutation, crossover and population initialization operators for a proposed MFEA to solve the CluSPT. Each of these operators deals with individuals in two phases, one of which ensures that the resulted individual is a spanning tree and the other phase ensures that each of its clustered sub-graphs is also a spanning tree. As the MFEA had to deal with these two tasks, a decoding method was also created to allow communication between the tasks. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods, the authors implemented them on both Euclidean and Non-Euclidean instances. Experiment results show that the proposed MFEA outperformed the existing MFEA algorithms on two-thirds instances with average improvement value of 47%. Besides, this paper analysis the convergence trends of each task in generations and the affectation of the number of vertices in the largest cluster on the obtained results by using both the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and scatter graphs.",17,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
236,306,A hybrid multifactorial evolutionary algorithm and firefly algorithm for the clustered minimum routing cost tree problem.,"The clustered minimum routing cost tree (CluMRCT) problem is a recent problem with a wide range of real-life applications, especially in designing computer networks with peer-to-peer architecture. Many multifactorial evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to solve multiple CluMRCT problems simultaneously. However, these algorithms only function effectively on complete graphs with small-and-medium sizes. Moreover, the blindness and randomness in the transfer of genetic materials cause a reduction in the exploitation ability and make these algorithms ineffective to solve low-similarity tasks. This paper proposes a hybrid multitasking algorithm named multifactorial firefly algorithm, which integrates the firefly algorithm’s strong exploitation ability to enhance the self-evolution of each task when facing low-similarity tasks while improving inter-task knowledge transfers by delivering higher-quality solutions. Also, the proposed algorithm is equipped with new encoding and decoding to focus more on potential search areas on both complete and sparse graphs. The experiments and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted on various instances to verify our proposal with several state-of-the-art methods. The results portrayed that the proposed encoding scheme helped multitasking algorithms improve solution quality by 32% on average. Besides, the statistical test values proved the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm in terms of solution quality and convergence trend.",17,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Minimum Routing Cost Clustered Tree Problem (CluMRCT) is a lately investigated topic that has significant application towards enhancing the interconnectivity among various devices. Belonging to NP-Hard class, the CluMRCT problem can be solved effectively by a meta-heuristic approach such as Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA), which can facilitate to find better solutions for multiple problems simultaneously. Recently, an improved framework (called MFEA-II) has been introduced to overcome the weakness of algorithm performance governed by the degree of underlying inter-task synergies in the previous version. Therefore, this paper proposes to apply MFEA-II for solving multiple CluMRCT problems concurrently with the population representation under a probabilistic distribution model adept at online learning. In the proposed algorithm, evolutionary operators are applied in two levels: the first level is to construct a spanning tree in each cluster, while the second one builds a spanning tree for connecting all clusters. To reduce consuming resources, this paper also introduces a new method to calculate the cost of CluMRCT solution in linear time complexity. Numerous types of test instances are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when its performance surpassed other state-of-the-art algorithms in most of the datasets.",17,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
238,309,A decomposition-based multi-objective optimization approach for balancing the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks.,"Wireless sensor networks consist of many sensor nodes with limited resources and computing capability. Thus, managing energy consumption to prolong network lifetime is a critical issue. Several approaches have been proposed to extend the network lifetime, one of which involves deploying relay nodes to transfer data from sensors to the base station. However, the limited number of relay nodes is a challenge that often goes overlooked. This paper examines the problem of optimizing the network lifetime and the number of relay nodes in three-dimensional terrains. A novel algorithm called MOEA/D-LS is proposed with the aim of obtaining a better tradeoff between two objectives.

Recently, some Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithms (MFEAs) have been introduced to deal with the CluSPT, but these researches still have some shortcomings, such as evolution operators only perform on complete graphs and huge resource consumption for finding the solution on large search spaces. To overcome these limitations, this paper describes an MFEA-based approach to solve the CluSPT. The proposed algorithm utilizes Dijkstra’s algorithm to construct the spanning trees in clusters while using evolutionary operators for building the spanning tree connecting clusters. This approach takes advantage of both exact and approximate algorithms, so it enables the algorithm to function efficiently on complete and sparse graphs alike. Furthermore, evolutionary operators such as individual encoding and decoding methods are also designed with great consideration regarding performance and memory usage. We have included proof of the repairing method’s efficacy in ensuring all solutions are valid. We have conducted tests on various types of Euclidean instances to assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods.

240,311,PoisonGAN: Generative Poisoning Attacks Against Federated Learning in Edge Computing Systems.,"Edge computing is a key-enabling technology that meets continuously increasing requirements for the intelligent Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To cope with the increasing privacy leakages of machine learning while benefiting from unbalanced data distributions, federated learning has been wildly adopted as a novel intelligent edge computing framework with a localized training mechanism. However, recent studies found that the federated learning framework exhibits inherent vulnerabilities on active attacks, and poisoning attack is one of the most powerful and secluded attacks where the functionalities of the global model could be damaged through attacker's well-crafted local updates. In this article, we give a comprehensive exploration of the poisoning attack mechanisms in the context of federated learning. We first present a poison data generation method, named Data_Gen, based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method mainly relies upon the iteratively updated global model parameters to regenerate samples of interested victims. Second, we further propose a novel generative poisoning attack model, named PoisonGAN, against the federated learning framework. This model utilizes the designed Data_Gen method to efficiently reduce the attack assumptions and make attacks feasible in practice. We finally evaluate our data generation and attack models by implementing two types of typical poisoning attack strategies, label flipping and backdoor, on a federated learning prototype. The experimental results demonstrate that these two attack models are effective in federated learning.",17,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
241,312,Evolutionary algorithm and multifactorial evolutionary algorithm on clustered shortest-path tree problem.,"In literature, Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem (CluSPT) is an NP-hard problem. Previous studies focus on approximation algorithms which search for an optimal solution in relatively large space. Thus, these algorithms consume a large amount of computational resources while the quality of obtained results is lower than expected. In order to enhance the performance of the search process, this paper proposes two different approaches which are inspired by two perspectives of analyzing the CluSPT. The first approach intuition is to narrow down the search space by reducing the original graph into a multi-graph with fewer nodes while maintaining the ability to find the optimal solution. The problem is then solved by a proposed evolutionary algorithm. This approach performs well on those datasets having small number of edges between clusters. However, the increase in the size of the datasets would cause the excessive redundant edges in multi-graph that pressurize searching for potential solutions. The second approach overcomes this limitation by breaking down the multi-graph into a set of simple graphs. Every graph in this set is corresponding to a mutually exclusive search space. From this point of view, the problem could be modeled into a bi-level optimization problem in which the search space includes two nested search spaces. Accordingly, the Nested Local Search Evolutionary Algorithm (N-LSEA) is introduced to search for the optimal solution of glscluspt, the upper level uses a simple Local Search algorithm while the lower level uses the Genetic Algorithm. Due to the neighboring characteristics of the local search step in the upper level, the lower level reduced graphs share the common traits among each others. Thus, the Multi-tasking Local Search Evolutionary Algorithm (MLSEA) is proposed to take advantages of these underlying commonalities by exploiting the implicit transfer across similar tasks of multi-tasking schemes. The improvement in experimental results over N-LSEA via this multi-tasking scheme inspires the future works to apply M-LSEA in graph-based problems, especially for those could be modeled into bi-level optimization.",17,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Traditionally, researchers have focused on solving relay node selection for either single-hop or multi-hop networks, one at a time.

243,314,Parameter adaptation in multifactorial evolutionary algorithm for many-task optimization.,"The advent of multifactorial optimization (MFO) has made a wind of change in intelligence computation in general and specifically in evolutionary computing. Based on the implicit parallelism of population-based search, MFO optimizes different problems simultaneously and entirely. However, the randomness of knowledge transfers raises the question of how to diminish harmful interactions among tasks for more effective transfers. In recent years, many proposals have been devised to handle this paradigm and improve existing algorithms. Notwithstanding the diversity in their concept, there are few efforts to solve many-task optimization (MaTO) that contains beyond three tasks. In light of this reason, this paper proposes two algorithms named SA-MFEA and LSA-MFEA for MaTO. Instead of utilizing fixed parameters, SA-MFEA and LSA-MFEA adapt the probability of random mating parameter to reduce negative transfers based on the historical memory of successful rmp. Besides, LSA-MFEA is capable of enhancing the exploitation by linear population size reduction. To examine the efficiency of the two proposed algorithms, experiments on various many-task benchmark problems and comparison with several state-of-the-art algorithms have been conducted.

245,316,A Two-level Genetic Algorithm for Inter-domain Path Computation under Node-defined Domain Uniqueness Constraints.,"Recent years have witnessed an increment in the number of network components communicating through many network scenarios such as multi-layer and multi-domain, and it may result in a negative impact on resource utilization. An urgent requirement arises for routing the packets most efficiently and economically in large multi-domain networks. In tackling this complicated area, we consider the Inter-Domain Path Computation problem under Node-defined Domain Uniqueness Constraint (IDPC-NDU), which intends to find the minimum routing cost path between two nodes that traverses every domain at most once. Owing to the NP-Hard property of the IDPC-NDU, applying metaheuristic algorithms to solve this problem usually proves more efficient. In like manner, this paper proposes a Two-level Genetic Algorithm (PGA), where the first level determines the order of the visited domains, and the second level finds the shortest path between the two given nodes. Furthermore, to facilitate the finding process, a method to minimize the search space and a new chromosome encoding that would reduce the chromosome length to the number of domains are integrated into this proposed algorithm. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposal, experiments on various instances were conducted. The results demonstrated that PGA outperforms other algorithms and gives results no more than twice the optimal values.",17,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
246,317,Effective Partial Charging Scheme For Minimizing The Energy Depletion And Charging Cost In Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks.,"Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network has emerged as a potential solution for the constrained energy problem in sensor networks in recent years. The charging process has been employed to prolong the sensor's lifetime. An effective charging algorithm requires simultaneously optimize the charging path and charging time at each charging location under the Mobile Charger's limited energy. The existing methods, however, are generally lacking in the literature. Moreover, most works are based on the assumption that Mobile Charger has sufficient or infinite energy to visit and charge all sensors within each charging cycle. This constraint leads to prolonging the waiting charging time of energy-hurry sensors and unnecessary visiting of energy-sufficient sensors. In this paper, we aim at minimizing energy depletion and the charging cost of Mobile Charger in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks without the mentioned limitations above.

247,318,A Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm For Minimum Energy Cost Data Aggregation Tree In Wireless Sensor Networks.,"In wireless sensor networks, the majority of data transmitted by sensor nodes is repeated over and over, and performing processes on them in many cases leads to increased power consumption and reduced network lifetime. Data aggregation is one of the techniques in reducing redundancy and improving energy efficiency; it also increases the lifespan of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we address the issues of constructing the data aggregation tree that minimizes the total energy cost of data transmissions for two types of networks: without relay nodes and using relay nodes. Traditionally, evolutionary algorithms focus on constructing data aggregation trees for either without relay node networks or using relay nodes networks.

248,319,Multi-Armed Bandits for Many-Task Evolutionary Optimization.,"Inspired by the ability of human multitasking, there is a growing body of literature in the computational intelligence community dedicated to solving multiple problems concurrently. One of the research areas that have been receiving much attention in this topic is evolutionary multitasking, which is able to solve multiple complicated optimization problems together, yielding a better result than solving them in isolation. However, researches on evolutionary multitasking mostly focus on solving a small number of problems together. In an attempt to improve evolutionary multitasking, we propose Many-Task Multi-Armed Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm (Ma 2 BEA), including a new structure for the evolutionary multitasking algorithm. It also adopts a well-proven result of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) as the method to control the adaptive knowledge exchange between different tasks. In particular, the action of selecting which task to perform inter-task crossover is learned and decided by the designed MAB agent. We verify that Ma 2 BEA correctly learned the underlying relationship between tasks using the simple 10-task benchmarks. Besides, Ma 2 BEA is compared with other evolutionary many-tasking algorithms that have recently been proposed using the Single-Objective Many-task benchmark from the WCCI 2020 Competition on Evolutionary Multi-task Optimization.

249,320,A Multi-task Approach For Maximum Survival Ratio Problem In Large-Scale Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks.,"With the breakthrough of electromagnetic power transfer technology, wireless charging has emerged as a hopeful solution for the energy provisioning problem in wireless sensor networks. One of the prominent issues that affect the potential exploitation of this technology is the charging scheduling problem. However, existing works on this topic either focus mainly on using a single mobile charger for the whole network or suffer from several common limitations such as enforcing the chargers to visit all sensors or applying the rigid full-charging scheme. Moreover, they rarely delve into maximizing the survival nodes ratio, which impacts directly on the multi-hop communication of the network. This paper addresses the charging scheduling for multiple mobile chargers without the above limitations. We first formulate a maximum survival ratio problem and prove its NP-hardness. A charging scheme that exploits the advantages of the multifactorial evolutionary algorithm is then proposed to optimize the charging paths of all chargers simultaneously. We finally evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulations. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheduling scheme provides promising outcomes in terms of survival ratio and the traveling energy of chargers.",17,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

In the networking fields, missing data prevents advanced analysis and downgrades downstream applications such as traffic engineering and anomaly detection. Despite the great potential, existing imputation approaches based on tensor decomposition and deep learning techniques have shown limitations in addressing missing values of traffic data due to its dynamic behavior. In this paper, we propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for Imputing Network Traffic (GCRINT), a combination between Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Neural Network, for filling the missing values of network traffic data. We use a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network and Graph Neural Network to efficiently learn the spatial-temporal correlations in partially observed data.

Due to the routing flexibility, SR has been widely used to solve traffic engineering problems such as minimizing the maximum link utilization. However, most of the prior works only solve the problem in a single snapshot without considering network traffic dynamics, resulting in frequent traffic reroute. To cope with this problem, we focus on solving the segment routing based traffic engineering problem by taking into account the future traffic changes. We formulate the multi-time-step segment routing problem and leverage traffic prediction to extend the length of routing cycles. Due to the large search space of multi-time-step segment routing problem, we further propose a heuristic algorithm for incrementally recomputing the segment routing paths in sub-second.

253,325,Efficient meta-heuristic approaches in solving minimal exposure path problem for heterogeneous wireless multimedia sensor networks in internet of things.,"One of the well-known methods for evaluating Heterogeneous wireless multimedia sensor networks (HWMSNs) in Internet of Things have drawn attention of the research community because this type of networks possesses great advantages of both coverage and performance. One of the most fundamental issues in HWMSNs is the barrier coverage problem which evaluates the surveillance capability of the network systems, especially those designed for security purposes. Among multiple approaches to solve this issue, finding the minimal exposure path (MEP), which corresponds to the worst-case coverage of the network is the most popular and efficient way. However, the MEP problem in HWMSNs (hereinafter heterogeneous multimedia MEP or HM-MEP) is specifically complex and challenging with the unique features of the HWMSNs. Thus, the problem is then converted into numerical functional extreme with high dimension, non-differential and non-linearity. Adapting to these features, two efficient meta-heuristic algorithms, Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA) and Gravitation Particle Swarm Optimization (GPSO) are proposed for solving the problem. The HEA is a hybrid evolutionary algorithm in combination with local search while the GPSO is a novel particle swarm optimization based on the gravity force theory.

254,326,Exploiting relay nodes for maximizing wireless underground sensor network lifetime.,"A major challenge in wireless underground sensor networks is the signal attenuation originated from multi-environment transmission between underground sensor nodes and the above-ground base station. To overcome this issue, an efficient approach is deploying a set of relay nodes aboveground, thereby reducing transmission loss by shortening transmitting distance. However, this introduces several new challenges, including load balancing and transmission loss minimization. This paper tackles the problem of deploying relay nodes to reduce transmission loss under a load balancing constraint by proposing two approximation algorithms. The first algorithm is inspired by Beam Search, combined with a new selection scheme based on Boltzmann distribution. The second algorithm aims to further improve the solutions obtained by the former by reducing the transmission loss.

LTGA performs well in various kinds of single-task optimization and yields promising results in comparison with the canonical genetic algorithm. However, LTGA is an unsuitable method for dealing with multi-task optimization problems. On the other hand, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) can simultaneously solve independent optimization problems, which are encoded in a unified representation to take advantage of the process of knowledge transfer. In this paper, we introduce Genetic Algorithm (MF-LTGA) by combining the main features of both LTGA and MFO. MF-LTGA is able to tackle multiple optimization tasks at the same time, each task learns the dependency between problem variables from the shared representation.

256,329,Towards optimal wireless sensor network lifetime in three dimensional terrains using relay placement metaheuristics.,"In wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes located close to the base station or sink are more susceptible to energy loss, leading to premature disconnection of the network or energy holes. This is due to the fact that all traffic is forwarded towards the sink, increasing the workloads for these closer nodes. One solution for this issue is to shorten the hop distance a sensor’s data has to travel until reaching the sink, by deploying additional relay nodes. This paper considers the problem of optimal relay node placement for maximizing the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks in three-dimensional terrains. We first design a mathematical model of the problem and reformulate it as a mixed-integer programming model to provide a basis for finding lower bound solutions. We divide the problem into two phases and show that the second phase can be solved exactly using an algorithm based on maximum flow and binary search. We then propose a local search algorithm for the first phase, utilizing the exact algorithm to create full solutions.

257,330,Multifactorial evolutionary algorithm for solving clustered tree problems: competition among Cayley codes.,"The Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has emerged as an effective variant of the evolutionary algorithm. MFEA has been successfully applied to deal with various problems with many different types of solution encodings. Although clustered tree problems play an important role in real life, there haven’t been much research on exploiting the strengths of MFEA to solve these problems. One of the challenges in applying the MFEA is to build specific evolutionary operators of the MFEA algorithm. To exploit the advantages of the Cayley Codes in improving the MFEA’s performance, this paper introduces MFEA with representation scheme based on the Cayley Code to deal with the clustered tree problems. The new evolutionary operators in MFEA have two different levels. The purpose of the first level is to construct a spanning tree which connects to a vertex in each cluster, while the objective of the second one is to determine the spanning tree for each cluster. We focus on evaluating the efficiency of the new MFEA algorithm on known Cayley Codes when solving clustered tree problems. In the aspect of the execution time and the quality of the solutions found, each encoding type of the Cayley Codes is analyzed when performed on both single-task and multi-task to find the solutions of one or two different clustered tree problems respectively. In addition, we also evaluate the effect of those encodings on the convergence speed of the algorithms. Experimental results show the level of effectiveness for each encoding type and prove that the Dandelion Code outperforms the remaining encoding mechanisms when solving clustered tree problems.",17,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
258,331,An Elite Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization for Solving Minimal Exposure Path Problem in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks.,"Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), a sub-class of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), have recently been a growing concern among the academic community. MWSNs can improve network coverage quality which reflects how well a region of interest is monitored or tracked by sensors. To evaluate the coverage quality of WSNs, we frequently use the minimal exposure path (MEP) in the sensing field as an effective measurement. MEP refers to the worst covered path along which an intruder can go through the sensor network with the lowest possibility of being detected. It is greatly valuable for network designers to recognize the vulnerabilities of WSNs and to make necessary improvements. Most prior studies focused on this problem under a static sensor network, which may suffer from several drawbacks; i.e., failure in sensor position causes coverage holes in the network. This paper investigates the problem of finding the minimal exposure paths in MWSNs (hereinafter MMEP). First, we formulate the MMEP problem. Then the MMEP problem is converted into a numerical functional extreme problem with high dimensionality, non-differentiation and non-linearity. To efficiently cope with these characteristics, we propose HPSO-MMEP algorithm, which is an integration of genetic algorithm into particle swarm optimization. Besides, we also create a variety of custom-made topologies of MWSNs for experimental simulations. The experimental results indicate that HPSO-MMEP is suitable for the converted MMEP problem and performs much better than existing algorithms.",17,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
259,332,Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm for Inter-Domain Path Computation under Domain Uniqueness Constraint.,"Nowadays, connectivity among communication devices in networks has been playing a significant role, especially when the number of devices is increasing dramatically that requires network service providers to have a better architecture of management system. One of the popular approach is to divide those devices inside a network into different domains, in which the problem of minimizing path computation in general or Inter-Domain Path Computation under Domain Uniqueness constraint (IDPC-DU) problem in specific has received much attention from the research community. Since the IDPC-DU is NP-complete, an approximate approach is usually taken to tackle this problem when the dimensionality is high. Although Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has emerged as an effective approximation algorithm to deal with various fields of problems, there are still some difficulties to apply directly MFEA to solve the IDPC-DU problem, i.e. different chromosomes may have different numbers of genes or to construct a feasible solution not violating the problem's constraint. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, MFEA algorithm with a new solution representation based on Priority-based Encoding is introduced. With the new representation of the solution, a chromosome consists of two parts: the first part encodes the priority of the vertex while the second part encodes information of edges in the solution. Besides, the paper also proposed a corresponding decoding method as well as novel crossover and mutation operators. Those evolutionary operators always produce valid solutions. For examining the efficiency of the proposed MFEA, experiments on a wide range of test sets of instances were implemented and the results pointed out the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the characteristics of the proposed algorithm are also indicated and carefully analyzed.",17,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

Firstly, they rarely tackle the dead node minimization problem, which is the ultimate objective of wireless charging. Secondly, most of the existing works assume impractical conditions, which include the unlimited battery capacity of the charger, and a fully charging scheme at the sensors.

Previous studies often search for an optimal solution in relatively large space. To enhance the performance of the search process, two approaches are proposed: the first approach seeks for solutions as a set of edges. From the original graph, we generate a new graph whose vertex set's cardinality is much smaller than that of the original one. Consequently, an effective Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is proposed for solving CluSPT. The second approach looks for vertex-based solutions. The search space of the CluSPT is transformed into 2 nested search spaces (NSS). With every candidate in the high-level optimization, the search engine in the lower level will find a corresponding candidate to combine with it to create the best solution for CluSPT. Accordingly, Nested Local Search EA (N-LSEA) is introduced to search for the optimal solution on the NSS. When solving this model in lower level by N-LSEA, variety of similar tasks are handled.

268,341,Efficient approximation approaches to minimal exposure path problem in probabilistic coverage model for wireless sensor networks.,"A well-known method for evaluating the coverage quality of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is using exposure as a measure, especially in barrier coverage problems. Among all studies related to exposure, discussions regarding the Minimal Exposure Path (MEP) problem have dominated research in recent years. The problem aims to find a path on which an intruder can penetrate through the sensing field with the lowest probability of being detected. This path along with its exposure value enables network infrastructure designers to identify the worst-case coverage of the WSN and make necessary improvements. Most prior research worked on the MEP problem under the assumption that there are no environmental factors such as vibration, temperature, etc., which causes errors in practical WSN systems. To overcome this drawback, we first formulate the MEP problem based on Probabilistic Coverage Model with noise (hereinafter PM-based-MEP) and introduce a new definition of the exposure metric for this model. The PM-based-MEP is then converted into a numerically functional extreme with high dimension, non-differentially and non-linearity. Adapting to these characteristics, we propose two approximation methods, GB-MEP and GA-MEP, for solving the converted problem. GB-MEP is based on the traditional grid-based method which is fine-tuned by several tweaks, and GA-MEP is formed by the genetic algorithm with a featured individual representation and an effective combination of genetic operators.

The major difference between WUSNs and terrestrial wireless sensor networks is that their signals travel through multiple layers: soil, air and a medium interface. As communications in heterogeneous channels result in more transmission loss, a solution is to deploy relay nodes to relay traffic from sensors to base stations/sinks. However, this poses several new challenges, including load balancing and transmission loss minimization in heterogeneous environments. This paper considers the problem of deploying relay nodes to prolong network lifetime under load balancing constraints. This problem can be formalized using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model as a basis to achieve lower bound solutions. We show that the problem is NP-hard as it can be reduced to the Set Cover Problem. Two novel methods are proposed.

270,343,Node placement for connected target coverage in wireless sensor networks with dynamic sinks.,"Target coverage and connectivity are two fundamental and critical issues in wireless sensor networks. The former is for providing sufficient monitoring quality where all points of interest in the network are covered by sensor nodes. The latter is for guaranteeing satisfactory communicating capability where all sensor nodes can connect to at least one sink via nodes (i.e., sensor nodes and relay nodes). Though considerable efforts have been devoted to optimize the placement of sensor nodes and relay nodes under connected target coverage constraint (i.e., guaranteeing both target coverage and connectivity), all of the existing works in this area address only networks with one static sink. In the meanwhile, although there are many works in literature considered the networks with dynamic sinks, none of them studies how to optimize the location of sensor and relay nodes. In this article, we focus on wireless sensor networks with dynamic sinks, which consist of multiple sinks and the sinks’ positions may change periodically, and study how to place a minimum number of nodes for connected target coverage. Specifically, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems. The first one, named as target coverage problem, is to place sensor nodes for covering all targets. The second one, named as network connectivity problem, is for placing relay nodes to connect sensor nodes to the sinks. We first formulate the target coverage problem under an integer linear programming model and present an exact algorithm to determine the optimal solution. We then propose a constant-approximation algorithm based on partitioning and shifting scheme. For the network connectivity problem, we first prove its NP-hardness and then propose two approximation algorithms.

The extension of the network’s lifetime is a critical issue in WUSNs, making it a topic of much interest in research. Several approaches have been proposed to keep the sensor nodes active, one of which is deploying relay nodes above ground to transfer data from sensor nodes to the base station. However, this method has faced issues, such as balancing the load of relay nodes and the increased transmission loss between relay nodes and sensor nodes. This paper addresses this concern and proposes two heuristics named Beam Genitor Search and Connection Swap for the relay node placement problem to guarantee load balance among relay nodes and maximize network lifetime.

275,348,Cow estrus detection with low-frequency accelerometer sensor by unsupervised learning.,"In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) has been applied successfully in agriculture. These technologies increase productivity as well as reduce labor significantly. In this paper, we focus on improving the autonomous cow estrus detection system in terms of energy consumption and precision. In previous detection pipelines, an accelerometer is mounted to the neck of cows to capture motion data with high frequency, followed by the ML algorithm to check the data and determine whether it is in estrus or not. Instead, we configured the accelerometer to sample with low frequency for minimizing its energy consumption. However, low-sampling rate as input of ML pipeline leads to an undesirable higher false alarm rate. To solve this problems, we designed a pipeline of unsupervised learning with a new heuristic post-processing algorithm. The proposed post-processing algorithm is a backtracking algorithm that incorporates the timing constraint of the period obtained by agriculture knowledge. With the constraint, the post-processing algorithm facilitates a significantly higher precision than simple adaptive threshold techniques in previous studies on a simulated dataset. Finally, the overall result of the pipeline with the proposed algorithm is visualized on real-world data captured on the farm in our agriculture department.",17,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
276,349,New Approach for Solving The Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem Based on Reducing The Search Space of Evolutionary Algorithm.,"Along with the development of manufacture and services, the problem of distribution network optimization has been growing in importance, thus receiving much attention from the research community. One of the most recently introduced network optimization problems is the Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem (CluSTP). Since the problem is NP-Hard, recent approaches often prefer to use approximation algorithms to solve it, several of which used Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and have been proven to be effective. However, most of the prior studies directly applied EAs to the whole CluSTP problem, which leads to a great amount of resource consumption, especially when the problem size is large. To overcome these limitations, this paper suggests a method for reducing the search space of the EAs applied to CluSTP by decomposing the original problem into two sub-problems, the solution to one of which is found by an EAs and that to the other is found by another method. The goal of the first sub-problem is to determine a spanning tree which connects among the clusters, while the goal of the second sub-problem is to determine the best spanning tree for each cluster. In addition, this paper proposes a new EAs, which can be applied to solve the first sub-problem and suggests using the Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the second sub-problem. The proposed approach is comprehensively experimented and compared with existing methods. Experimental results prove that our method is more efficient and more importantly, it can obtain results which are close to the optimal results.",17,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
277,351,Improved Cuckoo Search and Chaotic Flower Pollination optimization algorithm for maximizing area coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks.,"The popularity of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is rapidly growing due to its wide-ranged applications such as industrial diagnostics, environment monitoring or surveillance. High-quality construction of WSNs is increasingly demanding due to the ubiquity of WSNs. The current work is focused on improving one of the most crucial criteria that appear to exert an enormous impact on the WSNs performance, namely the area coverage. The proposed model is involved with sensor nodes deployment which maximizes the area coverage. This problem is proved to be NP-hard. Although such algorithms to handle this problem with fairly acceptable solutions had been introduced, most of them still heavily suffer from several issues including the large computation time and solution instability. Hence, the existing work proposed ways to overcome such difficulties by proposing two nature-based algorithms, namely Improved Cuckoo Search (ICS) and Chaotic Flower Pollination algorithm (CFPA). By adopting the concept of calculating the adaptability and a well-designed local search in previous studies, those two algorithms are able to improve their performance. The experimental results on 15 instances established a huge enhancement in terms of computation time, solution quality and stability.",17,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

The former is for providing sufficient monitoring quality where all points of interest in the network are covered by sensor nodes and the latter is for guaranteeing satisfactory communicating capability where all sensors can connect to at least one sink via relay nodes. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the number of nodes (i.e., sensor nodes and relay nodes) to provide target coverage and connectivity in wireless sensor networks with multiple sinks. We formulate the problem as two sub-problems. The first one (named as TC) is for placing sensor nodes to cover all targets and the second one (named as NC) is for placing relay nodes to connect sensor nodes to the sinks. We then propose a heuristic algorithm for the TC problem that exploits clustering technique. We also propose two heuristic algorithms for the NC problem that base on greedy approach and spanning tree.

279,353,Effective Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm for Solving the Cluster Shortest Path Tree Problem.,"Arising from the need of all time for optimization of irrigation systems, distribution network and cable network, the Cluster Shortest Path Tree Problem (CSTP) has been attracting a lot of attention and interest from the research community. For such an NP-Hard problem with a great dimensionality, the approximation approach is usually taken. Evolutionary Algorithms, based on biological evolution, has been proved to be effective in finding approximate solutions to problems of various fields. The multifactorial evolutionary algorithm (MFEA) is one of the most recently exploited realms of EAs and its performance in solving optimization problems has been very promising. The main difference between the MFEA and the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA) is that the former can solve multiple tasks at the same time and take advantage of implicit genetic transfer in a multitasking problem, while the latter solves one problem and exploit one search space at a time. Considering these characteristics, this paper proposes a MFEA for CSTP tasks, together with novel genetic operators: population initialization, crossover, and mutation operators. Furthermore, a novel decoding scheme for deriving factorial solutions from the unified representation in the MFEA, which is the key factor to the performance of any variant of the MFEA, is also introduced in this paper. For examining the efficiency of the proposed techniques, experiments on a wide range of diverse sets of instances were implemented and the results showed that the proposed algorithms outperformed an existing heuristic algorithm for most of the testing cases. In the experimental results section, we also pointed out which cases allowed for a good performance of the proposed algorithm.",17,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
280,354,A Guided Differential Evolutionary Multi-Tasking with Powell Search Method for Solving Multi-Objective Continuous Optimization.,"Recent years, the field of Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) has attracted remarkable consideration among evolutionary computation researchers. Evolutionary multitasking paradigm within the domain of MOO has been proposed and demonstrated on some benchmark test functions that indicates potential applications in real world problems. The concept of evolutionary multi-tasking is founded on the fact that individuals from various cultures may share their underlying similarities, thereby facilitating improved convergence characteristics. However, the designate algorithm for MOO multi-tasking is originated from pure genetic search that means it does not imply any advanced local refinement method which also improves the rate of convergence. Memetic algorithms, which is known as a synergy of evolutionary with separate individual learning or local improvement procedures for problem search, offers converging to high-quality solutions more efficiently than their conventional evolutionary counterparts. Accordingly, in this paper, to excel MOO multi-tasking paradigm performance, we propose an algorithm which is based on the idea of Multi-Factorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) employing Guided differential evolutionary and Powell local search. The accomplished experimental results point out using memetic techniques does an impressive enhancement on Multi-objective continuous optimization.",17,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

Recently, a potential approach is unsupervised learning on motion data of the cows, similar to human activity recognition based on motion. In particular, an accelerometer is attached to the neck of the cows to measure their acceleration, then the unsupervised algorithm group the measured acceleration time-series. Recent study adopted bag-of-feature and Discrete Fourier Transform for feature extraction, yet it may not reflect the nature of motion data. Thus, we proposed a method based on Discrete Wavelet Transform to get the multi-resolution feature, Dynamic Time Wraping as clustering distance and Iterative-K-Means as clustering algorithm, to better match with the characteristic of cowsâĂŹ movement.

Detecting and communicating these changes are still performed manually by responsible developers and administrators. Such a mechanism will not be adequate anymore in the future of large-scale IoT environments. Therefore, we present a comprehensive framework named DECOM for automatic detection and communication of service changes. Here, we assume that capabilities and interfaces of IoT devices are described and provided through REST services.

In particular, we first formulate the optimization problem of load balancing as a mixed integer linear program for achieving the optimal solution. We then develop the ORBIT algorithm that solves the online load balancing problem. The performance guarantee of ORBIT is analytically proved in comparison with the optimal offline solution.

The MEP not only improves the performance of WSNs but also guides the action of agents in the sensing field. Up to now, MEP has been focusing on solving problems in stationary sensor networks. MEP with both high dimensionality and non-linear property in stationary WSNs is NP-hard problem. This paper formulated a problem of finding the MEP in Mobile Sensor Networks (MSNs), in which sensors' mobility plays an important role in the execution of application, and then proposed a genetic algorithm to solve it. Our methodology is not only to calculate upper and lower bounds of exposure value, but also to determine the MEP trajectory.

The initial energy of each sensor node will be depleted continuously during data transmission to the base station either directly or through intermediate nodes, depending on the distance between sending and receiving nodes. This paper consider determining an optimal base station location such that the energy consumption is kept lowest, maximizing the network’s lifetime and propose a nonlinear programming model for this optimizing problem. Our proposed method for solving this problem is to combine methods mentioned in [1] respectively named the centroid, the smallest total distances, the smallest total squared distances and two greedy methods.

MRFs, with the most effective algorithm in message passing for training, will smooth out the segmentation results of STFs using pairwise coherent information between neighboring pixels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known benchmark datasets including the 21-class MSRC dataset and the VOC 2007 dataset.

323,398,Traffic behavior recognition using the pachinko allocation model,"CCTV-based behavior recognition systems have gained considerable attention in recent years in the transportation surveillance domain for identifying unusual patterns, such as traffic jams, accidents, dangerous driving and other abnormal behaviors. In this paper, a novel approach for traffic behavior modeling is presented for video-based road surveillance. The proposed system combines the pachinko allocation model (PAM) and support vector machine (SVM) for a hierarchical representation and identification of traffic behavior. A background subtraction technique using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and an object tracking mechanism based on Kalman filters are utilized to firstly construct the object trajectories. Then, the sparse features comprising the locations and directions of the moving objects are modeled by PAM into traffic topics, namely activities and behaviors. As a key innovation, PAM captures not only the correlation among the activities, but also among the behaviors based on the arbitrary directed acyclic graph (DAG). The SVM classifier is then utilized on top to train and recognize the traffic activity and behavior. The proposed model shows more flexibility and greater expressive power than the commonly-used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) approach, leading to a higher recognition accuracy in the behavior classification.",28,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

348,426,A general solution supporting real-time and remote electrocardiogram diagnostic based on embedded and mobile technology.,"Studying and applying computer science in supporting cardiovascular disease diagnostic have had many achievements in the world. In Vietnam, related studies, especially about Electrocardiogram- ECG (or EKG) are limited to theory researches and disconnected products, and have no complete solution to apply in healthcare centers, whereas foreign solutions are very expensive. In addition, having no up to date facilities, rural hospitals and healthcare centers in Vietnam cannot meet all the needs of patients and they have to move to big cities for treatment, while the diagnosis can be performed remotely with the advances in technology. Inspired from the actual needs and the growth of technology, we have proposed a general solution to manufacture ECG devices that has compact size, and their accuracy is equivalent with imported ones. We also develop software integrated with ECG devices that support users (patients and doctors) quickly and conveniently with smart-phone. We hope that our solution will bring more efficiency to healthcare centers in Vietnam, especially the doctor in large cities can support remote treatment for patients in rural hospitals.

351,430,Modeling Uncertainties in DC-DC Converters with MATLAB® and PLECS®.,"Modeling is the process of formulating a mathematical description of the system. A model, no matter how detailed, is never a completely accurate representation of a real physical system. A mathematical model is always just an approximation of the true, physical reality of the system dynamics. Uncertainty refers to the differences or errors between model and real systems and whatever methodology is used to present these errors will be called an uncertainty model. Successful robust control-system design would depend on, to a certain extent, an appropriate description of the perturbation considered. Modeling the uncertainties in the switch mode DC-DC converters is an important step in designing robust controllers. This book studies different techniques which can be used to extract the uncertain model of DC-DC converters. Once the uncertain model is extracted, robust control techniques such as 𝑯∞ and μ synthesis can be used to design the robust controller. The book is composed of two case studies. The first one is a buck converter and the second one is a Zeta converter. MATLAB® programming is used extensively throughout the book. Some sections use PLECS® as well. This book is intended to be guide for both academicians and practicing engineers.

To exploit the correlation in WSNs, the correlation model is required. However, most of the present correlation models are linear and distance-dependent. This paper proposes a general distance-independent entropy correlation model based on the relation between joint entropy and the number of members in a group. This relation is estimated using entropy of individual members and entropy correlation coefficients of member pairs. The proposed model is then applied to evaluate two data aggregation schemes in WSNs including data compression and representative schemes. In the data compression scheme, some main routing strategies are compared and evaluated to find the most appropriate strategy. In the representative scheme, with the desired distortion requirement, a method to calculate the number of representative nodes and the selection of these nodes are proposed. The practical validations showed the effectiveness of the proposed correlation model and data reduction schemes.",25,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

This paper presents our approach to build the basic-level knowledge network (BKN) as a commonsense and how it is used for robotic services. In this paper, we focused on two services. One is ‘bring something’ and the other is ‘tidy things up’. We found that for ‘bring something’, relationship between object-activity is important, and for ‘tidy things up’ service, knowledge about relationship between object-place is more important. To perform these services at the practical level, many relative knowledge should be prepared.

It is very difficult for a robot to do tasks ordered by a human without having some basic knowledge to understand the human's commands. This paper proposes a method to automatically build commonsense knowledge for the “Tidy-up” service, in which a robot is asked to take objects such as books, cups, dishes on a table to appropriate places automatically. We defined three object classes that are necessary for the service, namely “Washable”-objects that need to be washed, “Reusable”-objects that need to be stored for reuse, and “Trashable”-objects that need to be disposed of. For each object, multiple attributes were extracted from both the ConceptNet knowledge base and the Google search engine, and fed to classifiers to classify the object into the appropriate class. To evaluate the proposed method, output from classifiers were compared with the result from actual human. The result showed that the proposed approach is efficient in classifying objects and in providing object type as commonsense knowledge, hence, helping the robots to understand human intention and to provide intuitive service.",25,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

We used the novel extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBR) technique together with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for feature selection to construct and verify a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 105 sampling plots conducted in November and December of 2018 and incorporated the dual polarimetric (HH and HV) data of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and the Sentinel-2 multispectral data combined with Sentinel-1 (C-band VV and VH) data. We employed the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The capability of the XGBR-GA model was assessed via a comparison with other machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e., the CatBoost regression (CBR), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) models. The XGBR-GA model yielded a promising result (R2 = 0.683, RMSE = 25.08 Mg·ha−1) and outperformed the four other ML models. The XGBR-GA model retrieved a mangrove AGB ranging from 17 Mg·ha−1 to 142 Mg·ha−1 (with an average of 72.47 Mg·ha−1).

366,445,Browser Extension-based Crowdsourcing Model for Website Monitoring.,"Websites play an increasingly important role. They are not only a good marketing resource but also a power business tool. To make websites reliable and always available for customers, a large number of website monitoring services have been developed to periodically check the website uptime and performance. These services typically have a very limited number of checkpoints (i.e., geographical locations where we send monitoring requests to check the websites) and internet service providers (ISP) used by these checkpoints; it is because deploying checkpoints with low usage frequency would waste them a huge amount of money. Thus they cannot detect that a website is reachable from a city and an ISP but is unreachable from the others. To address this issue, this paper presents a crowdsourcing-based approach that makes use of browser extensions as checkpoints to monitor websites. Our main contributions include: (i) a website monitoring approach that combines the concepts of crowdsourcing and browser extensions; (ii) a batch processing technique for handling monitoring requests; (iii) the architecture of a conceptual crowdsourcing-based system for website monitoring that can coordinate a large number of crowd members; and (iv) various techniques to enhance the quality of monitoring.",27,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning

Consequently, web developers have to do tedious works of identifying which parts of server source pages (i.e. server-side source codes that generate HTML client pages) cause non-conformant client elements. Unlike these tools, our framework allows directly reporting and suggesting solutions for the elements in the server source pages. The proposed method composes of four steps. First, the HTML client page and the server source page are parsed. Second, the elements of HTML client page that are non-conformant with the WCAG success criteria are identified and reported. Third, a mapping between the HTML client page and the server source page is established. Fourth, fixes to the server source page are suggested; this implies automatic modification of the code of server source page.

The idea is to use constraints for expressing the application logic of a coordinated system and its required security strategies. Coordination activities are the key concepts used for controlling the execution of participating services. Constraints are specified as pre and post conditions of these coordination activities.

Decentralization means that there is no single authority responsible for generating secret cryptographic keys for system users. Therefore, the scheme eliminates the concern of having a single point of failure as the central authority could be attacked, become malicious, or become unavailable. Recent attacks have shown that the centralized approach could lead to system malfunctioning or to leaking sensitive information. Another achievement of the proposed BE schemes is their performance characteristics that make them suitable for environments with light-weight clients, such as in Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.

For GPGPUs, multiple-application execution can increase the data parallelism, resulting in high resource utilization. However, applications have different execution time depending on their workload sizes. Therefore, if one application is completed earlier than the other ones, resource underutilization problem may happen because the hardware resource allocated for the early completed application become idle. In this work, a CTA-aware dynamic streaming multiprocessors scheduling scheme is proposed for multiple-application execution in the GPGPU to efficiently manage hardware resources.

However, when subjected to routing holes (ie, regions without sensor nodes that have communication capability), geographic routing suffers from the so-called local minimum phenomenon, where packets are stopped at the hole boundary. This local minimum phenomenon results in problems of load imbalance (ie, a higher traffic intensity around the hole boundary) and routing path enlargement due to the long hole detour paths.

To avoid that issue, this paper introduces a novel protocol (namely, TELPAC) which efficiently locate the hole boundary and determine the patching locations.

Also, a significant enlargement on routing path is still possible due to the possibly significant difference between this forbidding area and the hole.

In such a context, designing a charging strategy that optimally prolongs the network lifetime is challenging. This work aims to solve the challenges by introducing a novel, on-demand charging algorithm for MC that attempts to maximize the network lifetime, where the term “network lifetime” is defined by the interval from when the network starts till the first target is not monitored by any sensor. The algorithm, named Fuzzy Q-charging, optimizes both the time and location in which the MC performs its charging tasks. Fuzzy Q-charging uses Fuzzy logic to determine the optimal charging-energy amounts for sensors. From that, we propose a method to find the optimal charging time at each charging location. Fuzzy Q-charging leverages Q-learning to determine the next charging location for maximizing the network lifetime. To this end, Q-charging prioritizes the sensor nodes following their roles and selects a suitable charging location where MC provides sufficient power for the prioritized sensors.

In this description, the PSSR is presumed to be the primary driver of the paradigm, with upwelling growth dependent on PSSR strength. As constructed, the paradigm describes EPB development when PSSR is strong (i.e., high solar activity), but not when it is weak. We, show, for the first time, that when PSSR is weak (e.g., low solar activity), upwelling growth can still be comparable in strength to what would be considered a strong PSSR, and that this growth drives EPB development. Given that EPBs do not develop outside of upwellings, regardless of solar activity, we are led to conclude, against mainstream thinking, that the controlling driver for EPB development is upwelling growth, not PSSR. For continued progress toward understanding EPB development, a crucial next step is to identify the source mechanism for upwelling growth, especially when PSSR is weak, and to better understand the complexities of the underlying physics.",50,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

In this paper, we develop the method of non-uniform unit selection using many different types of units. We find that the quality of speech is directly related to the size of the units used. This method was applied in different ways in different languages.

Quantitative method is used in the study where questionnaires are sent to 250 independent auditors and 186 valid questionnaires are encrypted, declared and entered into SPSS software version 22.0. The results show that in audit techniques, except for document testing and verification technique, there were significant differences in application level of material testing, observation, interview, calculation and analysis techniques between big 4 firms and non-big 4 firms.

However, little has been known about this issue in the context of constrained resources such as in Vietnam. The objective of this study was to examine the adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients receiving acute myocardial infarction interventions and its associated factors. In a cross-sectional survey design, 175 adult patients revisiting Vietnam National Heart Institute diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction were approached for data collection from October 2014 to June 2015. Adherence to antiplatelet therapy was assessed by asking patients whether they took taking antiplatelet regularly as per medication (do not miss any dose at the specified time) for any type of antiplatelet (aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine...) during the last month before the participants came back to take re-examinations. The results indicated that the adherence to antiplatelet therapy among patients was quite high at 1 month; it begins to decline by 6 months, 12 months, and more than 12 months (less than 1 month was 90.29%; from 1 to 6 months 88.0%, from 6 to 12 months 75.43%, and after 12 months only 46.29% of patients).

Recently, several approximation algorithms with guaranteed approximation ratio have been proposed to solve the MLP problem.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the principles of the subgradient method. It still uses the set of solutions of the k −MST or k −troll problem as an input, then modifies each solution into a tour with cost smaller than that of Eulerian tour and finally, uses obtained tours to construct a MLP tour. Since the low cost tours are used to build a MLP tour, we can expect the approximation ratio of obtained algorithm will be improved.

In 2013, 68% of the total population was covered by SHI, with most enrollees from compulsory groups. Enrollment has remained low among persons whose enrollment is voluntary. As a result, households face financial risk due to high out-of-pocket payments for health care. The goal of this study is to identify willingness to pay (WTP) for the SHI scheme among persons whose enrollment is voluntary and to examine factors that influence their choice. Method Three hundred thirty-one (331) uninsured persons from three districts and one city of Thua Thien Hue province were interviewed face to face using a structured questionnaire. Contingent valuation technique was used to assess the WTP among the study participants.

Predictions about system and computation behaviors must be done based on deep knowledge about underlying infrastructures, and simulations' mathematical and realization backgrounds. Our conceptual framework is intended to allow independent collaborations between domain experts as end-users and providers of the computational power by taking on all of the deployment troubles arising within a given computing environment. The goal of our work is to provide a generalized approach for effective scalable usage of the computing power and to help domain-experts, so that they could concentrate more intensive on their domain solutions without the need of investing efforts in learning and adapting to the new IT backbone technologies.",65,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

To resolve the problem, it is necessary to model the prediction process of the pedestrian agent in order to specify a point-of-conflict area. In this paper, we propose an approach for our pedestrian agent to navigate in this situation.

In our research, we proposed a novel approach using reinforcement learning for simulation of pedestrian agent path planning and collision avoidance problem.

To address this problem, we proposed a novel simulation model for the local path-planning process of the pedestrian agent, adopting reinforcement learning to replicate the navigation path. We also addressed the problem of assessing the obstacle’s risk by determining its probability of collision with the obstacle, combining with the danger from the obstacle. This process is subsequently incorporated with our prediction model to provide an accurate navigation path similar to the human thinking process. Our proposed model’s implementation demonstrates a more favorable result than other simulation models, especially in the case of the obstacle’s appearance.

However, these methods usually focus on the sentence and skip the influence of the previous sentences. In the paper, we introduce a novel approach to transform from sentences with context to embedding vectors based on auto-encoder architecture.

One of the possible reasons is that the current models often ignore the cognitive factors in the human thinking process. Another reason is that many models try to approach the problem by optimising certain objectives. On the other hand, in real life, humans do not always take the most optimised decisions, particularly when interacting with other people. To improve the navigation behaviour in this circumstance, we proposed a pedestrian interacting model using reinforcement learning.

This strong initial interest in mashup technologies and promising use case demonstrations notwithstanding, however, commercial platforms such as Microsoft Popfly, IBM Mashup Center, and Google Mashup Editor failed to gain widespread adoption by consumers and enterprises and were eventually discontinued. This failure may be attributed to a number of common limitations of these platforms:(i) they are each useful only for a single or a limited number of restricted problems in specific domains;(ii) they are closed, ie, developers cannot contribute and share their widgets;(iii) widgets, which are crucial elements of any mashup platform, are usually not modeled in sufficient semantic detail to support widget search and composition features that facilitate reuse. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing an open mashup platform based on semantic web technologies. We present a novel architecture in which widgets equipped with a semantic, graph-based model can cooperate with each other in a mashup created by end users through simple drag and drop operations.

Furthermore, the large amounts of environmental data that stream in continuously require novel processing approaches. So far, however, research at the intersection of environmental sciences and urban data to overcome these barriers has been scarce. To address these issues, we develop a novel framework using semantic web technologies. We apply ontological concepts and semantic stream processing technologies in order to facilitate combination, comparison, and visualization of heterogeneous data from various sources.

One possible explanation is the gap between the large amounts of published LOD datasets and the lack of end-user tools to effectively explore them. Because existing applications are tailored towards specific datasets and do not allow for reuse and extension, novice users have so far had limited means to access the rich data sources being published. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach to support non-expert users in the flexible exploration of LOD.

This problem is challenging due to the large variation of pose, illumination and facial expression. A promising approach to deal with pose variation is to fulfill incomplete UV maps extracted from in-the-wild faces, then attach the completed UV map to a fitted 3D mesh and finally generate different 2D faces of arbitrary poses. The synthesized faces increase the pose variation for training deep face recognition models and reduce the pose discrepancy during the testing phase. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called Attention ResCUNet-GAN to improve the UV map completion. We enhance the original UV-GAN by using a couple of U-Nets. Particularly, the skip connections within each U-Net are boosted by attention gates. Meanwhile, the features from two U-Nets are fused with trainable scalar weights.

Using complementary information from different views can improve view changing and occlusion problems. However, how to effectively integrate the information from multi-view images? In this paper, we propose an effective approach for multi-view human action recognition. The proposition is based on attention mechanism to pass discriminate feature between views. It is designed to form a multi-branch network whose each branch takes responsibility for extracting a view-specific feature. Furthermore, we built a cross-view attention module to enhance action recognition by transferring knowledge between views (branches). Experiments on three datasets show that the proposed solution works effectively in different scenarios. Our models have achieved the best results on two datasets (NUMA and MicaHandGesture) for both cross-subject and cross-view evaluations. On the NUMA dataset, the accuracy of our best models reach to 99.56% and 92.74% in cross-subject and cross-view evaluation scenarios respectively.

However, in many cases, the MAP problem is non-convex and intractable. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, called BOPE, which uses Bernoulli randomness for Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation. We show that BOPE has a fast convergence rate. In particular, BOPE implicitly employs a prior which plays as regularization. Such a prior is different from the one of the MAP problem and will be vanishing as BOPE does more iterations. This property of BOPE is significant and enables to reduce severe overfitting for probabilistic models in ill-posed cases, including short text, sparse data, and noisy data. We validate the practical efficiency of BOPE in two contexts: text analysis and recommender systems.

695,850,Object Counting Based on Density Using Perspective Transformation.,"This paper presents a framework to count objects in images with perspective issues. The counting framework based on density estimation of the two authors Victor Lempitsky and Andrew Zisserman [1] produces excellent results in counting objects that are severely overlapped. However, the framework does not address the perspective issues, which frequently happen in many situations. It assumes that the subjected objects have the same size in every location of the images. Therefore, we propose a perspective model and integrate it into the existing density estimation framework to reduce the error caused by perspective distortions. In order to generate the perspective model, the heights of some objects are collected in addition to their locations to learn a perspective map. Using the map, we estimate the heights of the objects based on their positions in the images. The framework is adapted to exploit the height information of objects to customize the size of the normalized 2D Gaussian kernel, which is used to generate the ground truth density of images, and the size of the Gaussian window when computing the Scale- Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features. The adapted framework is then applied to count the number of motorbikes in Hanoi streets. The results are later compared with the ones produced by the original framework to see the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Our proposed framework performs better in high-density images while maintaining competitive accuracy in low-density images.",29,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Therefore, this paper proposes a method to improve the quality of adversarial examples by recognizing and then removing such perturbations. The proposed method includes two phases namely the autoencoder training phase and the improvement phase. In the autoencoder training phase, the proposed method trains an autoencoder that learns how to recognize redundant perturbations. In the second phase, the proposed method uses the trained autoencoder in combination with the greedy improvement step to produce more high-quality adversarial examples.

Given a regex, AREXT can generate a set of positive and negative strings with 100% coverage of nodes, edges, and edge pairs. We leverage prior works of synthesizing regexes from natural language to create benchmarks for evaluating AREXT. Some current tools, i.e., EGRET and MUTREX, are also being evaluated and compared. Experiments show that AREXT can outperform EGRET as AREXT can detect more unexpected synthesized regexes in almost all benchmarks. The evaluation results indicate that strings with 100% coverage metrics (generated by AREXT) or strings with maximum mutation score (generated by MUTREX) are not enough to ensure the correctness of regexes under test. Experiments also show that combining AREXT, EGRET, and MUTREX can detect a majority of unwanted synthesized regexes (87–91%).",30,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

However, these algorithms all have their own drawbacks such as long processing duration, huge data requirements, extremely computational consumption, and low accuracy response. In this circumstance, in this paper, a novel algorithm based on a combination of deep learning and camera geometry is proposed for vehicle distance estimation. The proposed algorithm demonstrates fast processing duration which is contributed by the deep learning base technique. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity of camera geometry, the proposed algorithm requires minimal data to perform the estimation. By combining deep learning and camera geometry, the proposed algorithm can provide high estimation accuracy while keeping the model simple and fast. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through experiments results.",34,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
720,878,A Feasible Study of Cube Sensing Organization Map for Cognitive Spectrum Allocation.,"Spectrum availability has been considered as one of the most crucial factors for the success of serving dense user devices in fifth generation (5G) mobile communications and beyond. To this end, cognitive spectrum sensing technologies can be utilized to detect unused wireless channels in the coverage area of the user devices, which are possibly used for device-to-device communications efficiently. However, frequent wide range sensing of spectrum extremely exhausts energy resource of the user devices. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic cognitive spectrum sensing (PCSS) mechanism to overcome this challenge. In the PCSS mechanism, a cube sensing organization map (CSOM) is dimensionalized on the basis of channels and locations in the coverage area. Weight of each block in the CSOM represents the probability that a user device successfully senses the corresponding channel idle in the corresponding location. The weight of each block is learned after every sensing periods to reinforce the CSOM. Consequently, user devices sense the list of channels in their proximity with the probabilities indicated by the weight of the best matching CSOM blocks. Simulation results show that the PCSS mechanism overcomes the existing techniques in terms of energy efficiency and positive sensing ratio.",34,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
721,879,A hybrid genetic algorithm for the traveling salesman problem with drone.,"This paper addresses the traveling salesman problem with drone (TSP-D), in which a truck and drone are used to deliver parcels to customers. The objective of this problem is to either minimize the total operational cost (min-cost TSP-D) or minimize the completion time for the truck and drone (min-time TSP-D). This problem has gained a lot of attention in the last few years reflecting the recent trends in a new delivery method among logistics companies. To solve the TSP-D, we propose a hybrid genetic search with dynamic population management and adaptive diversity control based on a split algorithm, problem-tailored crossover and local search operators, a new restore method to advance the convergence and an adaptive penalization mechanism to dynamically balance the search between feasible/infeasible solutions. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two existing methods in terms of solution quality and improves many best known solutions found in the literature. Moreover, various analyses on the impacts of crossover choice and heuristic components have been conducted to investigate their sensitivity to the performance of our method.",34,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

A truck can be scheduled to take a trailer, and then transports different containers from depots to customers or from customers to terminals or from terminals to customers or from customers to depots. In a planning, a truck can carry one 40ft container or two 20ft containers at a time. Moreover, in case of a long waiting time for unloading, a truck can be detached from a trailer at a customers and attached to another trailer for other itineraries.

The model contains many real-life case features and is presented by a mathematical formulation. We study both static and dynamic scenarios in comparison to traditional strategies, i.e., the direct delivery model. Moreover, we classify speed windows by different zones and congestion levels during a day in the urban context. Different speed windows induce the dynamic graph model for road networks and make the problem much more difficult to solve. Because of the complex model, the preprocessing steps on data as well as on dynamic graphs are very important. We use a greedy algorithm to initiate the solution and then use some local search techniques to improve the solution quality. The experimental data set is recorded by Tokyo-Musen Taxi company. The data set includes more than 20000 requests per day, more than 4500 used taxis per day and more than 130000 crossing points on the Tokyo map.

737,896,LS(Graph): a constraint-based local search framework for constrained optimum tree and path problems on graphs.,"onstrained Optimum Tree (COT) and Constrained Optimum Path (COP) are two classes of problems which arise in many real-life applications and are ubiquitous in communication networks, transportations, very large scale integration (VLSI) and distributed systems. Most of these problems are computationally very hard to solve. They have been traditionally approached by dedicated algorithms including heuristics and exact algorithms, which are often hard to extend with side constraints and to apply widely because they depend strongly on the problem structures. Moreover, it is required huge research and programming efforts for solving new problems. In this thesis, we construct a constraint-based local search (CBLS) framework, called LS(Graph), for solving COT/COP applications, bringing the compositionality, reuse, and extensibility at the core of CBLS and CP systems. The modeling contribution is the ability to express compositional models for various COT/COP applications at a high level of abstraction, while cleanly separating the model and the search procedure. The LS(Graph) framework will strengthen the modeling benefits of CBLS. By using LS(Graph), users can quickly develop a local search algorithm for a new problem which gives, in most of cases, an acceptable solution while waiting for experts who do research with huge efforts for dedicated algorithms. Moreover, this solution can be used as the initial solution in more complex and hybrid algorithms. The main technical contribution is a connected neighborhood based on rooted spanning trees. The idea behind is to use rooted spanning tree for representing solutions which are paths and their neighborhoods. This approach enables the genericity of the framework from both modeling and computation standpoints. The constructed framework is applied to some three COT (i.e., the edge-weighted k-cardinality tree problem, the quorumcast routing problem, the problem of minimizing congestions on ethernet networks) and four COP problems (i.e., the resource constrained shortest path problem, the edge-disjoint paths problem, the routing and wavelength assignment with delay side constraint problem, and the routing for network covering problem). Experimental results show the potential benefits of the approach. On the one hand, we show the facility and the genericity of the resolution of the COT/COP applications which can be extended with side constraints. On the other hand, for the quorumcast routing and the edge-disjoint paths problems, we show competitive results in comparing with existing techniques.",34,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

743,903,Constant approximation for opportunistic sensing in mobile air quality monitoring system.,"Monitoring air quality plays a critical role in the sustainable development of developing regions where the air is severely polluted. Air quality monitoring systems based on static monitors often do not provide information about the area each monitor represents or represent only small areas. In addition, they have high deployment costs that reflect the efforts needed to ensure sufficient quality of measurements. Meanwhile, the mobile air quality monitoring system, such as the one in this work, shows the feasibility of solving those challenges. The system includes environmental sensors mounted on buses that move along their routes, broadening the monitoring areas. In such a system, we introduce a new optimization problem named opportunistic sensing that aims to find (1) optimal buses to place the sensors and (2) the optimal monitoring timing to maximize the number of monitored critical regions. We investigate the optimization problem in two scenarios: simplified and general bus routes. Initially, we mathematically formulate the targeted problem and prove its NP-hardness. Then, we propose a polynomial-time -, -approximation algorithm for the problem with the simplified, general routes, respectively. To show the proposed algorithms’ effectiveness, we have evaluated it on the real data of real bus routes in Hanoi, Vietnam. The evaluation results show that the former algorithm guarantees an average performance ratio of 72.68%, while the latter algorithm achieves the ratio of 63.87%. Notably, when the sensors can be on (e.g., enough energy) during the whole route, the -approximation algorithm achieves the approximation ratio of .

751,911,Constraint-based local search for solving non-simple paths problems on graphs: application to the routing for network covering problem.,"Routing problems have been considered as central problems in the fields of transportation, distribution and logistics. LS(Graph) is a generic framework allowing to model and solve constrained optimum paths problems on graphs by local search where paths are known to be elementary (i.e., edges, vertices cannot be repeated on paths). In many real-world situations, the paths to be determined are not known to be neither simple nor elementary. In this paper, we extend the LS(Graph) framework by designing and implementing abstractions that allow to model and solve constrained paths problem where edges, vertices can be repeated on paths (call non-simple paths). We also propose an instance of such problem class: the routing for network covering (RNC) problem which arises in the context of rescue after a natural disaster in which we have to route a fleet of identical vehicles with limited capacity on a transportation network in order to collect the informations of the disaster. Given an undirected weighted graph G = (V, E) representing a transportation network and a vertex v0 ∈ V representing the depot, the RNC problem consists of routing a fleet of unlimited number of identical vehicles with limited capacity that cannot perform a path of length > L such that each vehicle starts from and teminates at the depot and all the edges of a given set S (S ⊆ E) must be visited. The objective of the routing plan is to minimize the number of vehicles used. This paper discusses the challenge around this problem and applies the constructed framework to the resolution of this problem.

Many works based on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for face PAD formulate the problem as an image-level binary classification task without considering the context. Alternatively, Vision Transformers (ViT) using self-attention to attend the context of an image become the mainstreams in face PAD. Inspired by ViT, we propose a Video-based Transformer for face PAD (ViTransPAD) with short/long-range spatio-temporal attention which can not only focus on local details with short attention within a frame but also capture long-range dependencies over frames. Instead of using coarse image patches with single-scale as in ViT, we propose the Multi-scale Multi-Head Self-Attention (MsMHSA) architecture to accommodate multi-scale patch partitions of Q, K, V feature maps to the heads of transformer in a coarse-to-fine manner, which enables to learn a fine-grained representation to perform pixel-level discrimination for face PAD. Due to lack inductive biases of convolutions in pure transformers, we also introduce convolutions to the proposed ViTransPAD to integrate the desirable properties of CNNs by using convolution patch embedding and convolution projection. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed ViTransPAD with a preferable accuracy-computation balance, which can serve as a new backbone for face PAD.",38,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

754,915,Predicting Brain Degeneration with a Multimodal Siamese Neural Network *.,"To study neurodegenerative diseases, longitudinal studies are carried on volunteer patients. During a time span of several months to several years, they go through regular medical visits to acquire data from different modalities, such as biological samples, cognitive tests, structural and functional imaging. These variables are heterogeneous but they all depend on the patient’s health condition, meaning that there are possibly unknown relationships between all modalities. Some information may be specific to some modalities, others may be complementary, and others may be redundant. Some data may also be missing. In this work we present a neural network architecture for multimodal learning, able to use imaging and clinical data from two time points to predict the evolution of a neurodegenerative disease, and robust to missing values. Our multimodal network achieves 92.5% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.978 over a test set of 57 subjects. We also show the superiority of the multimodal architecture, for up to 37.5% of missing values in test set subjects’ clinical measurements, compared to a model using only the clinical modality.",38,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
755,916,Vector space model adaptation and pseudo relevance feedback for content-based image retrieval.,"Image retrieval is an important problem for researchers in computer vision and content-based image retrieval (CBIR) fields. Over the last decades, many image retrieval systems were based on image representation as a set of extracted low-level features such as color, texture and shape. Then, systems calculate similarity metrics between features in order to find similar images to a query image. The disadvantage of this approach is that images visually and semantically different may be similar in the low level feature space. So, it is necessary to develop tools to optimize retrieval of information. Integration of vector space models is one solution to improve the performance of image retrieval. In this paper, we present an efficient and effective retrieval framework which includes a vectorization technique combined with a pseudo relevance model. The idea is to transform any similarity matching model (between images) to a vector space model providing a score. A study on several methodologies to obtain the vectorization is presented. Some experiments have been undertaken on Wang, Oxford5k and Inria Holidays datasets to show the performance of our proposed framework",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

Linked to a specific context of small expert datasets without prior knowledge, our research work focuses on improving the discriminative power of the image representation while keeping the same efficiency for retrieval. Based on the well-known bag of visual words model, we propose three different methodologies inspired by the visual phrase model effectiveness and a compression technique which ensures the same effectiveness for retrieval than the BoVW model. Our experimental results study the performance of our proposals on different well known benchmark datasets and show its good performance compared to other recent approaches.",38,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
757,918,Study of CNN Based Classification for Small Specific Datasets.,"Recently, deep learning and particularly, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), has become predominant in many application fields, including visual image classification. In an applicative context of detecting areas with hazard of dengue fever, we propose a classification framework using deep neural networks on a limited dataset of images showing urban sites. For this purpose, we have to face multiple research issues: (i) small number of training data; (ii) images belonging to multiple classes; (iii) non-mutually exclusive classes. Our framework overcomes those issues by combining different techniques including data augmentation and multi-scale/region-based classification, in order to extract the most discriminative information from the data. Experiment results present our framework performance using several CNN architectures with different parameter sets, without and with transfer learning. Then, we analyze the effect of data augmentation and multiscale region based classification. Finally, we show that adding a classification weighting scheme allows the global framework to obtain more than 90% average precision for our classification task.",38,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
758,919,Deep CNN and Data Augmentation for Skin Lesion Classification.,"Deep CNN techniques have dramatically become the state of the art in image classification. However, applying high-capacity Deep CNN in medical image analysis has been impeded because of scarcity of labeled data. This study has two primary contributions: first, we propose a classification model to improve performance of classification of skin lesion using Deep CNN and Data Augmentation. Second, we demonstrate the use of image data augmentation for overcoming the problem of data limitation and examine the influence of different number of augmented samples on the performance of different classifiers. The proposed classification system is evaluated using the largest public skin lesion testing dataset, containing 600 testing images, and 6,162 training images. New state-of-the-art performance result is archived with AUC (89.2% vs. 87.4%), AP (73.9% vs. 71.5%), and ACC (89.0% vs. 87.2%). In additional, we explore the influence of each image augmentation on the three classifiers and observe that performance of each classifier is influenced differently by each augmentation and has better results comparing with traditional methods. Thus, it is suggested that the performance of skin cancer classification and medial image classification could be improved further by applying data augmentation.",38,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
759,920,FaceLiveNet: End-to-End Networks Combining Face Verification with Interactive Facial Expression-Based Liveness Detection.,"The effectiveness of the state-of-the-art face verifi-cation/recognition algorithms and the convenience of face recognition greatly boost the face-related biometric authentication applications. However, existing face verification architectures seldom integrate any liveness detection or keep such stage isolated from face verification as if it was irrelevant. This may potentially result in the system being exposed to spoof attacks between the two stages. This work introduces FaceLiveNet, a holistic end-to-end deep networks which can perform face verification and liveness detection simultaneously. An interactive scheme for facial expression recognition is proposed to perform liveness detection, providing better generalization capacity and higher security level. The proposed framework is low-cost as it relies on commodity hardware instead of costly sensors, and lightweight with much fewer parameters comparing to the other popular deep networks such as VGG16 and FaceNet. Experimental results on the benchmarks LFW, YTF, CK+, OuluCASIA, SFEW, FER2013 demonstrate that the proposed FaceLiveNet can achieve state-of-art performance or better for both face verification and facial expression recognition. We also introduce a new protocol to evaluate the global performance for face authentication with the fusion of face verification and interactive facial expression-based liveness detection.",38,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Such ordered structures require attributes discretization and it is known that, for decision trees, local discretization improves the classification performance compared with global discretization. While most literature on discretization for Galois lattices relies on global discretization, the presented work introduces a new local discretization algorithm for Galois lattices which hinges on a property of some specific lattices that we introduce as dichotomic lattices. Their properties, co-atomicity and ∨-complementarity are proved along with their links with decision trees. Finally, some quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the local discretization are proposed.",38,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
761,922,DocCreator: A New Software for Creating Synthetic Ground-Truthed Document Images.,"Most digital libraries that provide user-friendly interfaces, enabling quick and intuitive access to their resources, are based on Document Image Analysis and Recognition (DIAR) methods. Such DIAR methods need ground-truthed document images to be evaluated/compared and, in some cases, trained. Especially with the advent of deep learning-based approaches, the required size of annotated document datasets seems to be ever-growing. Manually annotating real documents has many drawbacks, which often leads to small reliably annotated datasets. In order to circumvent those drawbacks and enable the generation of massive ground-truthed data with high variability, we present DocCreator, a multi-platform and open-source software able to create many synthetic image documents with controlled ground truth. DocCreator has been used in various experiments, showing the interest of using such synthetic images to enrich the training stage of DIAR tools.",38,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
762,923,Simple Triplet Loss Based on Intra/Inter-Class Metric Learning for Face Verification.,"Recently, benefiting from the advances of the deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), significant progress has been made in the field of the face verification and face recognition. Specially, the performance of the FaceNet has overpassed the human level performance in terms of the accuracy on the datasets ""Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)"" and ""Youtube Faces in the Wild (YTF)"". The triplet loss used in the FaceNet has proved its effectiveness for face verification. However, the number of the possible triplets is explosive when using a large scale dataset to train the model. In this paper, we propose a simple class-wise triplet loss based on the intra/inter-class distance metric learning which can largely reduce the number of the possible triplets to be learned. However the simplification of the classic triplet loss function has not degraded the performance of the proposed approach. The experimental evaluations on the most widely used benchmarks LFW and YTF show that the model with the proposed class-wise simple triplet loss can reach the state-of-the-art performance. And the visualization of the distribution of the learned features based on the MNIST dataset has also shown the effectiveness of the proposed method to better separate the classes and make the features more discriminative in comparison with the other state-of-the-art loss function.",38,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

764,925,Impact of OCR Errors on the Use of Digital Libraries: Towards a Better Access to Information.,"Digital collections are increasingly used for a variety of purposes. In Europe only, we can conservatively estimate that tens of thousands of users consult digital libraries daily. The usages are often motivated by qualitative and quantitative research. However, caution must be advised as most digitized documents are indexed through their OCRed version, which is far from perfect, especially for ancient documents. In this paper, we aim to estimate the impact of OCR errors on the use of a major online platform: The Gallica digital library from the National Library of France. It accounts for more than 100M OCRed documents and receives 80M search queries every year. In this context, we introduce two main contributions. First, an original corpus of OCRed documents composed of 12M characters along with the corresponding gold standard is presented and provided, with an equal share of English- and French-written documents. Next, statistics on OCR errors have been computed thanks to a novel alignment method introduced in this paper. Making use of all the user queries submitted to the Gallica portal over 4 months, we take advantage of our error model to propose an indicator for predicting the relative risk that queried terms mismatch targeted resources due to OCR errors, underlining the critical extent to which OCR quality impacts on digital library access.",38,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

A document retrieval system is proposed inspired from our previous method for logo spotting and recognition. First, the key-points from both the query logo images and a given set of document images are extracted and described by SIFT descriptor, and are matched in the SIFT feature space. They are filtered by the nearest neighbor matching rule based on the two nearest neighbors and are then post-filtered with BRIEF descriptor. Secondly, logo segmentation is performed using spatial density-based clustering, and homography is used to filter the matched key-points as a post processing. Finally, for ranking, we use two measures which are calculated based on the number of matched key-points. Tested on a well-known benchmark database of real world documents containing logos Tobacco-800, our approach achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

In this second edition, we focus on the staff removal task and simulate a real case scenario concerning old and degraded music scores. For this purpose, we have generated a new set of semi-synthetic images using two degradation models that we previously introduced: local noise and 3D distortions. In this extended paper we provide an extended description of the dataset, degradation models, evaluation metrics, the participant’s methods and the obtained results that could not be presented at ICDAR and GREC proceedings due to page limitations.",38,9,recognition algorithm routing network detection networks using search multiple problem machine prediction fast software power 
768,938,An efficient parametrization of character degradation model for semi-synthetic image generation.,"This paper presents an efficient parametrization method for generating synthetic noise on document images. By specifying the desired categories and amount of noise, the method is able to generate synthetic document images with most of degradations observed in real document images (ink splotches, white specks or streaks). Thanks to the ability of simulating different amount and kind of noise, it is possible to evaluate the robustness of many document image analysis methods. It also permits to generate data for algorithms that employ a learning process. The degradation model presented in [7] needs eight parameters for generating randomly noise regions. We propose here an extension of this model which aims to set automatically the eight parameters to generate precisely what a user wants (amount and category of noise). Our proposition consists of three steps. First, Nsp seed-points (i.e. centres of noise regions) are selected by an adaptive procedure. Then, these seed-points are classified into three categories of noise by using a heuristic rule. Finally, each size of noise region is set using a random process in order to generate degradations as realistic as possible.",38,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
769,939,Generation of learning samples for historical handwriting recognition using image degradation.,"Historical documents pose challenging problems for training handwriting recognition systems. Besides the high variability of character shapes inherent to all handwriting, the image quality can also differ greatly, for instance due to faded ink, ink bleed-through, wrinkled and stained parchment. Especially when only few learning samples are available, it is difficult to incorporate this variability in the morphological character models. In this paper, we investigate the use of image degradation to generate synthetic learning samples for historical handwriting recognition. With respect to three image degradation models, we report significant improvements in accuracy for recognition with hidden Markov models on the medieval Saint Gall and Parzival data sets.",38,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
770,940,Improving Logo Spotting and Matching for Document Categorization by a Post-Filter Based on Homography.,"Digital document categorization based on logo spotting and recognition has raised a great interest in the research community because logos in documents are sources of information for categorizing documents with low costs. In this paper, we present an approach to improve the result of our method for logo spotting and recognition based on key point matching and presented in our previous paper [7]. First, the key points from both the query document images and a given set of logos (logo gallery) are extracted and described by SIFT, and are matched in the SIFT feature space. Secondly, logo segmentation is performed using spatial density-based clustering. The contribution of this paper is to add a third step where homography is used to filter the matched key points as a post-processing. And finally, in the decision stage, logo classification is performed by using an accumulating histogram. Our approach is tested using a well-known benchmark database of real world documents containing logos, and achieves good performances compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",38,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
771,941,A Discriminative Approach to On-Line Handwriting Recognition Using Bi-character Models.,"Unconstrained on-line handwriting recognition is typically approached within the framework of generative HMM-based classifiers. In this paper, we introduce a novel discriminative method that relies, in contrast, on explicit grapheme segmentation and SVM-based character recognition. In addition to single character recognition with rejection, bi-characters are recognized in order to refine the recognition hypotheses. In particular, bi-character recognition is able to cope with the problem of shared character parts. Whole word recognition is achieved with an efficient dynamic programming method similar to the Viterbi algorithm. In an experimental evaluation on the Unipen-ICROW-03 database, we demonstrate improvements in recognition accuracy of up to 8% for a lexicon of 20,000 words with the proposed method when compared with an HMM-based baseline system. The computational speed is on par with the baseline system.",38,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
772,942,Semi-synthetic Document Image Generation Using Texture Mapping on Scanned 3D Document Shapes.,"This article presents a method for generating semi-synthetic images of old documents where the pages might be torn (not flat). By using only 2D deformation models, most existing methods give non-realistic synthetic document images. Thus, we propose to use 3D approach for reproducing geometric distortions in real documents. First, a new proposed texture coordinate generation technique extracts texture coordinates of each vertex in the document shape (mesh) resulting from 3D scanning of a real degraded document. Then, any 2D document image can be overlayed on the mesh by using an existing texture image mapping method. As a result, many complex real geometric distortions can be integrated in generated synthetic images. These images then can be used for enriching training sets or for performance evaluation. The degradation method here is jointly used with the character degradation model we proposed in [1] to generate the 6000 semi-synthetic degraded images of the music score removal staff line competition of ICDAR 2013.",38,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
773,943,Invariants Extraction Method Applied in an Omni-language Old Document Navigating System.,"We are currently working on the concept of an omni script and interactive word retrieval system for ancient document collection navigation, based on query composition for non-expert users. To make the query, the user selects and composes writing pieces, which are invariants automatically extracted from the old document collection. In order to extract invariants from documents, strokes must be first extracted and clustered. Stroke extraction raises two main difficulties: detecting the ambiguous zones so as to extract primary strokes (writing pieces which do not contain any ambiguous zone) and grouping the primary strokes so as to form invariants. In this paper, we present existing methods for ambiguity zones detection and compare these methods on documents of different languages and periods to find out which one is more adapted in our context. Once ambiguous zones have been extracted, some neighboring primary strokes are grouped so as to obtain strokes and our clustering algorithm is applied over these strokes to find their representatives, i.e. the invariants. These invariants can further be used by the user to compose his/her query and to retrieve words from the document collection.",38,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
774,944,An experimental comparison of clustering methods for content-based indexing of large image databases.,"In recent years, the expansion of acquisition devices such as digital cameras, the development of storage and transmission techniques of multimedia documents and the development of tablet computers facilitate the development of many large image databases as well as the interactions with the users. This increases the need for efficient and robust methods for finding information in these huge masses of data, including feature extraction methods and feature space structuring methods. The feature extraction methods aim to extract, for each image, one or more visual signatures representing the content of this image. The feature space structuring methods organize indexed images in order to facilitate, accelerate and improve the results of further retrieval. Clustering is one kind of feature space structuring methods. There are different types of clustering such as hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, grid-based clustering, etc. In an interactive context where the user may modify the automatic clustering results, incrementality and hierarchical structuring are properties growing in interest for the clustering algorithms. In this article, we propose an experimental comparison of different clustering methods for structuring large image databases, using a rigorous experimental protocol. We use different image databases of increasing sizes (Wang, PascalVoc2006, Caltech101, Corel30k) to study the scalability of the different approaches.",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
775,945,A character degradation model for grayscale ancient document images.,"Kanungo noise model is widely used to test the robustness of different binary document image analysis methods towards noise. This model only works with binary images while most document images are in grayscale. Because binarizing a document image might degrade its contents and lead to a loss of information, more and more researchers are currently focusing on segmentation-free methods (Angelika et al [2]). Thus, we propose a local noise model for grayscale images. Its main principle is to locally degrade the image in the neighbourhoods of “seed-points” selected close to the character boundary. These points define the center of “noise regions”. The pixel values inside the noise region are modified by a Gaussian random distribution to make the final result more realistic. While Kanungo noise models scanning artifacts, our model simulates degradations due to the age of the document itself and printing/writing process such as ink splotches, white specks or streaks. It is very easy for users to parameterize and create a set of benchmark databases with an increasing level of noise. These databases will further be used to test the robustness of different grayscale document image analysis methods (i.e. text line segmentation, OCR, handwriting recognition).",38,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

In this paper, we present an approach for logo spotting, based on the matching of keypoints extracted both from the query document images and a given set of logos (gallery) using SIFT. In order to filter the matching points and keep only the most relevant, we compare the spatial distribution of the matching keypoints in the query image and in the logo gallery. We test our approach using a large collection of real world documents using a well-known benchmark database of logos and show that our approach achieves good performances compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",38,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
777,947,A protocol to characterize the descriptive power and the complementarity of shape descriptors.,"Most document analysis applications rely on the extraction of shape descriptors, which may be grouped into different categories, each category having its own advantages and drawbacks (O.R. Terrades et al. in Proceedings of ICDAR’07, pp. 227–231, 2007). In order to improve the richness of their description, many authors choose to combine multiple descriptors. Yet, most of the authors who propose a new descriptor content themselves with comparing its performance to the performance of a set of single state-of-the-art descriptors in a specific applicative context (e.g. symbol recognition, symbol spotting...). This results in a proliferation of the shape descriptors proposed in the literature. In this article, we propose an innovative protocol, the originality of which is to be as independent of the final application as possible and which relies on new quantitative and qualitative measures. We introduce two types of measures: while the measures of the first type are intended to characterize the descriptive power (in terms of uniqueness, distinctiveness and robustness towards noise) of a descriptor, the second type of measures characterizes the complementarity between multiple descriptors. Characterizing upstream the complementarity of shape descriptors is an alternative to the usual approach where the descriptors to be combined are selected by trial and error, considering the performance characteristics of the overall system. To illustrate the contribution of this protocol, we performed experimental studies using a set of descriptors and a set of symbols which are widely used by the community namely ART and SC descriptors and the GREC 2003 database.",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

Coming from the field of data mining techniques, most literature on the subject using Galois lattices relies on selection-based strategies, which consists of selecting/choosing the concepts which encode the most relevant information from the huge amount of available data. Generally, the classification step is then processed by a classical classifier such as the k-nearest neighbors rule or the Bayesian classifier. Opposed to these selection-based strategies are navigation-based approaches which perform the classification stage by navigating through the complete lattice (similar to the navigation in a classification tree), without applying any selection operation. Our approach, named Navigala, proposes an original navigation-based approach for supervised classification, applied in the context of noisy symbol recognition. Based on a state of the art dealing with Galois Lattices classification based methods, including a comparison between possible selection and navigation strategies, this paper proposes a description of NAVIGALA and its implementation in the context of symbol recognition. Some objective quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the approach are proposed, in order to highlight the relevance of the method.",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

These structural signatures-that can be seen as dynamic paths which carry high-level information-are robust toward various transformations.

Indeed GL is classically defined from a binary table (called context), and therefore in the presence of continuous data a discretization step is generally needed to convert continuous data into discrete data. Discretization is classically performed before the GL construction in a global way. However, local discretization is reported to give better classification rates than global discretization when used jointly with other symbolic classification methods such as decision trees (DTs). Using a result of lattice theory bringing together set of objects and specific nodes of the lattice, we identify subsets of data to perform a local discretization for GLs.

783,954,Cursive On-line Handwriting Word Recognition Using a Bi-character Model for Large Lexicon Applications.,"This paper deals with on-line handwriting recognition in a closed-world environment with a large lexicon. Several applications using handwriting recognition have been developed, but most of them consider a lexicon of limited size. Many difficulties, in particular confusions during the segmentation stage, are linked to the use of a large lexicon, with large writing variations and an increased complexity of the connections between characters. In order to circumvent these problems, we introduce in this paper an original method based on a new analytical approach using two levels of recognition models: an isolated character recognizer and an original bi-character recognition model. The idea behind the bi-character model is to recognize jointly two neighboring characters. The objective is to reduce the confusions between characters occurring during the segmentation step. Experiments show an interesting improvement of the recognition rate when introducing the bi-character model, as the recognition rate is increased of 7.2% for a 1000 words lexicon, of 9.1% for a 2000 words lexicon, and up to 15% for a 10000 words lexicon.",38,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

In a second step, the features are fed into a NRBFN that learns class conditional probabilities. This results in an efficient and computationally simple open-world identification process. Experimental results assess the performance and robustness of the proposed algorithm compared to other subspace methods combined with NRBFNs, in the presence of variations in head poses, facial expressions, and partial occlusions.",38,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

BDA relies on the maximization of a generalized Fisher criterion based on bilinear projections of face image matrices. In a second step, the experts are combined to assign an identity with a confidence measure to each of the query faces.

786,958,Two-Dimensional-Oriented Linear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition.,"In this paper, a new statistical projection-based method called Two-Dimensional- Oriented Linear Discriminant Analysis (2DO-LDA) is presented. While in the Fisherfaces method the 2D image matrices are first transformed into 1D vectors by merging their rows of pixels, 2DO-LDA is directly applied on matrices, as 2D-PCA. Within and between-class image covariance matrices are generalized, and 2DO-LDA aims at finding a projection space jointly maximizing the second and minimizing the first by considering a generalized Fisher criterion defined on image matrices. A series of experiments was performed on various face image databases in order to evaluate and compare the effectiveness and robustness of 2DO-LDA to 2D-PCA and the Fisherfaces method. The experimental results indicate that 2DO-LDA is more efficient than both 2D-PCA and LDA when dealing with variations in lighting conditions, facial expression and head pose.",38,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
787,959,Comparing Robustness of Two-Dimensional PCA and Eigenfaces for Face Recognition.,"In this paper, we aim at evaluating the robustness of 2D-PCA for face recognition, and comparing it with the classical eigenfaces method. For most applications, a sensory gap exists between the images collected and those used for training. Consequently, methods based upon statistical projection need several preprocessing steps: face detection and segmentation, rotation, rescaling, noise removal, illumination correction, etc... This paper determines, for each preprocessing step, the minimum accuracy required in order to allow successful face recognition with 2D-PCA and compares it with the eigenfaces method. A series of experiments was conducted on a subset of the FERET database and digitally-altered versions of this subset. The tolerances of both methods to eight different artifacts were evaluated and compared. The experimental results show that 2D-PCA is significantly more robust to a wide range of preprocessing artifacts than the eigenfaces method.",38,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
788,963,A graph convolutional topic model for short and noisy text streams.,"Learning hidden topics from data streams has become absolutely necessary but posed challenging problems such as concept drift as well as short and noisy data. Using prior knowledge to enrich a topic model is one of potential solutions to cope with these challenges. Prior knowledge that is derived from human knowledge (e.g. Wordnet) or a pre-trained model (e.g. Word2vec) is very valuable and useful to help topic models work better. However, in a streaming environment where data arrives continually and infinitely, existing studies are limited to exploiting these resources effectively. Especially, a knowledge graph, that contains meaningful word relations, is ignored. In this paper, to aim at exploiting a knowledge graph effectively, we propose a novel graph convolutional topic model (GCTM) which integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) into a topic model and a learning method which learns the networks and the topic model simultaneously for data streams. In each minibatch, our method not only can exploit an external knowledge graph but also can balance the external and old knowledge to perform well on new data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method with both a human knowledge graph (Wordnet) and a graph built from pre-trained word embeddings (Word2vec). The experimental results show that our method achieves significantly better performances than state-of-the-art baselines in terms of probabilistic predictive measure and topic coherence. In particular, our method can work well when dealing with short texts as well as concept drift.",42,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
789,964,From implicit to explicit feedback: A deep neural network for modeling sequential behaviours and long-short term preferences of online users.,"In this work, we examine the advantages of using multiple types of behaviours in recommendation systems. Intuitively, each user often takes some implicit actions (e.g., click) before making an explicit decision (e.g., purchase). Previous studies show that implicit and explicit feedback has different roles for a useful recommendation. However, these studies either exploit implicit and explicit behaviours separately or ignore the semantics of sequential interactions between users and items. In addition, we go from the hypothesis that a user’s preferences at a time are combinations of long-term and short-term interests. In this paper, we propose some Deep Learning architectures. The first one is Implicit to Explicit (ITE), to exploit users’ interests through the sequence of their actions. The second and third ones are two versions of ITE with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based (BERT-based) architecture called BERT-ITE and BERT-ITE-Si, which combine users’ long- and short-term preferences without and with side information to enhance users’ representations. The experimental results show that our models outperform previous state-of-the-art ones and also demonstrate our views on the effectiveness of exploiting the implicit to explicit order as well as combining long- and short-term preferences in three large-scale datasets.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

However, most previous works focus on word embeddings which are either non-discriminative or hardly interpretable. In this work, we investigate a novel approach, referred to as SWET, which learns supervised word embeddings using topic models from labeled corpora. SWET inherits the interpretability of topic models, the discriminativeness of supervised inference from labels. More importantly, SWET enables us to directly exploit a large class of existing unsupervised and supervised topic models to learn supervised word embeddings. Extensive experiments show that SWET outperforms unsupervised approaches by a large margin, and are highly competitive with supervised baselines.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
791,966,Boosting prior knowledge in streaming variational Bayes.,"Exploiting prior/human knowledge is an effective way to enhance Bayesian models, especially in cases of sparse or noisy data, for which building an entirely new model is not always possible. There is a lack of studies on the effect of external prior knowledge in streaming environments, where the data come sequentially and infinitely. In this work, we show the problem of vanishing prior knowledge in streaming variational Bayes. This is a serious drawback in various applications. We then develop a simple framework to boost the external prior when learning a Bayesian model from data streams. By boosting, the prior knowledge can be maintained and efficiently exploited through each minibatch of streaming data. We evaluate the performance of our framework in four scenarios: streaming in synthetic data, streaming sentiment analysis, streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation, and streaming text classification, in comparison with the methods that do not keep priors. From extensive experiments, we find that when provided good external knowledge, our framework can improve the performance of a Bayesian model, often by a significant margin for noisy and short text streams.",42,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
792,967,Structured Dropout Variational Inference for Bayesian Neural Networks.,"Approximate inference in Bayesian deep networks exhibits a dilemma of how to yield high fidelity posterior approximations while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. We tackle this challenge by introducing a novel variational structured approximation inspired by the Bayesian interpretation of Dropout regularization. Concretely, we focus on the inflexibility of the factorized structure in Dropout posterior and then propose an improved method called Variational Structured Dropout (VSD). VSD employs an orthogonal transformation to learn a structured representation on the variational Gaussian noise with plausible complexity, and consequently induces statistical dependencies in the approximate posterior. Theoretically, VSD successfully addresses the pathologies of previous Variational Dropout methods and thus offers a standard Bayesian justification. We further show that VSD induces an adaptive regularization term with several desirable properties which contribute to better generalization. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of VSD over state-of-the-art variational methods on predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution detection.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

The same situation also remains largely open for deep neural networks. To fill this gap, we introduce a Lipschitz theory to analyze generalization. We demonstrate its simplicity by analyzing generalization and consistency of overparameterized neural networks. We then use this theory to derive Lipschitz-based generalization bounds for GANs. Our bounds show that penalizing the Lipschitz constant of the GAN loss can improve generalization. This result answers the long mystery of why the popular use of Lipschitz constraint for GANs often leads to great success, empirically without a solid theory. Finally but surprisingly, we show that, when using Dropout or spectral normalization, both \emph{truly deep} neural networks and GANs can generalize well without the curse of dimensionality.",42,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

We propose the Neural Poisson factorization (NPF) model which is a hybrid of deep learning and Poisson factorization. While Poisson factorization is suitable to model discrete, massive and sparse feedback, using a deep neural network and pre-trained word embeddings can learn hidden semantic in short item descriptions well. Therefore, NPF overcomes the limitation of existing models when dealing with short texts and a sparse feedback matrix. Moreover, we develop a random view algorithm based on stochastic learning for our model, in which each user is only viewed a random subset of items and his/her feedback on the subset is used to update his/her representation in each iteration. This approach is reasonable because each user can only know or view a partial subset of items when surfing a system. Extensive experiments illustrate the significant advantages of NPF over content-based matrix factorization methods and others that ignore item descriptions.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

However, in many cases, the MAP problem is non-convex and intractable. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm, called BOPE, which uses Bernoulli randomness for Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation. We show that BOPE has a fast convergence rate. In particular, BOPE implicitly employs a prior which plays as regularization. Such a prior is different from the one of the MAP problem and will be vanishing as BOPE does more iterations. This property of BOPE is significant and enables to reduce severe overfitting for probabilistic models in ill-posed cases, including short text, sparse data, and noisy data. We validate the practical efficiency of BOPE in two contexts: text analysis and recommender systems. Both contexts show the superior of BOPE over the baselines.",42,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
796,971,Bag of biterms modeling for short texts.,"Analyzing texts from social media encounters many challenges due to their unique characteristics of shortness, massiveness, and dynamic. Short texts do not provide enough context information, causing the failure of the traditional statistical models. Furthermore, many applications often face with massive and dynamic short texts, causing various computational challenges to the current batch learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel framework, namely bag of biterms modeling (BBM), for modeling massive, dynamic, and short text collections. BBM comprises of two main ingredients: (1) the concept of bag of biterms (BoB) for representing documents, and (2) a simple way to help statistical models to include BoB. Our framework can be easily deployed for a large class of probabilistic models, and we demonstrate its usefulness with two well-known models: latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). By exploiting both terms (words) and biterms (pairs of words), the major advantages of BBM are: (1) it enhances the length of the documents and makes the context more coherent by emphasizing the word connotation and co-occurrence via bag of biterms, and (2) it inherits inference and learning algorithms from the primitive to make it straightforward to design online and streaming algorithms for short texts. Extensive experiments suggest that BBM outperforms several state-of-the-art models. We also point out that the BoB representation performs better than the traditional representations (e.g., bag of words, tf-idf) even for normal texts.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
797,972,Predictive Coding for Locally-Linear Control.,"High-dimensional observations and unknown dynamics are major challenges when applying optimal control to many real-world decision making tasks. The Learning Controllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding the observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent dynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure the learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing LCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform next-observation prediction—a challenging high-dimensional task that furthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the decoder) which are discarded during control. In this paper, we propose a novel information-theoretic LCE approach and show theoretically that explicit next-observation prediction can be replaced with predictive coding. We then use predictive coding to develop a decoder-free LCE model whose latent dynamics are amenable to locally-linear control. Extensive experiments on benchmark tasks show that our model reliably learns a controllable latent space that leads to superior performance when compared with state-of-the-art LCE baselines.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

800,975,Eliminating overfitting of probabilistic topic models on short and noisy text: The role of dropout.,"Probabilistic topic models are powerful tools for discovering hidden structures/semantics in discrete data, e.g., texts, images, links. However, on short and noisy texts, directly applying topic models may not work well or face severe overfitting. In this article, we investigate the benefits of dropout for preventing topic models from overfitting. We integrate dropout into several stochastic methods for learning latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). From extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets, our findings are: (1) dropout helps to prevent overfitting and significantly enhance predictiveness and generalization of LDA on short texts; (2) for long documents, dropout may provide little benefit; (3) dropout can be easily integrated into any learning methods to avoid overfitting for short and noisy text. Furthermore, dropout can be straightforwardly employed in a wide range of topic models. In evidence, we apply dropout to BTM (Biterm topic model), one of the state-of-the-art models for short texts. Our experiments illustrate that BTM with dropout not only remains its good results in term of predictiveness, but also improves the learning time significantly.",42,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

In this work, we explore this property in a multi-task learning framework for IDRR in which the relations and the connectives are simultaneously predicted, and the mapping is leveraged to transfer knowledge between the two prediction tasks via the embeddings of relations and connectives. We propose several techniques to enable such knowledge transfer that yield the state-of-the-art performance for IDRR on several settings of the benchmark dataset (i.e., the Penn Discourse Treebank dataset).",42,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

However, it has to face the famous stability-plasticity dilemma and the problem of noisy and sparse data. We propose a novel and easy-to-implement framework, called Infinite Dropout (iDropout), to address these challenges. iDropout has an easy mechanism to balance between old and new information, which allows models to trade off stability against plasticity. Thanks to the ability to reduce overfitting and the ensemble property of Dropout, our framework obtains better generalization, thus effectively handles undesirable effects of noise and sparsity. Further, iDropout is able to adapt quickly to abnormal changes in data streams. We theoretically analyze the equivalence of Dropout in iDropout to a regularizer, well applied to a much larger context than what was known before. Extensive experiments show that iDropout significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",42,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
803,978,Marking Mechanism in Sequence-to-sequence Model for Mapping Language to Logical Form.,"Semantic parsing in Natural language processing (NLP) is a challenging task, which has been studied for many years. The main purpose is to model the language as a logical form like a machine translation task. Recently, an approach which uses a Neural network with Sequence to sequence model (Seq2seq) has achieved positive results. However, there are many challenges which have not been solved thoroughly yet, especially in the problem of rare words. Rare words in a natural sentence are usually the name of an object, a place or number, time, etc. Although these words are very various and difficult for the model to capture meaning, it holds a key information role in human communication (for example: name all the rivers in colorado ?). There are some methods to solve this problem such as using Attention or using Copy mechanism. However, these methods still difficult to copy phrase rare words, especially in case these phrases are variable in size. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve this problem, namely Marking mechanism in Seq2seq. The main idea is to label special words which are rare-words in a sentence by the encoder (marking step) and the decoder represents the logical form based on those labels (transforming step). Our experiments demonstrate that this approach works effectively, achieved a competitive result with old methods on all 3 datasets Geo, Atis, Jobs and special outperformed on our Artificial dataset.",42,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
804,979,Enriching User Representation in Neural Matrix Factorization.,"Personalized recommendation is a crucial problem in the era of information overload. One of the most prominent methods addressing this problem is collaborative filtering (CF). Recently, NeuMF [1] has employed Deep Neural Network to facilitate traditional CF methods. Although NeuMF achieved the state-of-the-art performance, it is expected that predictive accuracy can be improved by enriching user representation. In this paper, we propose a neural network incorporating latent features and personalized information of users, namely Feature based Neural Matrix Factorization (FeaNMF). In FeaNMF, personalized information can be considered as auxiliary features which are generated by associating past behavior of users (e.g, purchase history, browsing activity, watching habits) with item categories. By explicitly modeling personalized information in the metric of item categories, the major advantages of FeaNMF are: (1) it enriches user representation and thus enhances the predictive capability, (2) it inherits the advantages of NeuMF to model the latent features in a more comprehensive approach, rather than applying a simple linear function as existing methods (e.g. Matrix Factorization), and (3) it is easy to extend FeaNMF for employing a large amount of external sources to construct user preferences.

CTMP excels in predictive performance under different real-world recommendation contexts, and easily scales to big datasets, while recovering interpretable user profiles. Moreover, our empirical study also shows strong evidence that sparsity in the estimates of topic mixture can be recovered via learning, despite not being specified in the model.

The problem of posterior inference for individual texts is very important in streaming environments, but is often intractable in the worst case. To avoid directly solving this problem which is NP-hard, some proposed existing methods for posterior inference are approximate but do not have any guarantee on neither quality nor convergence rate. Based on the idea of Online Frank-Wolfe algorithm by Hazan [2] and improvement of Online Maximum a Posteriori Estimation algorithm (OPE) by Than [3, 4], we propose a new effective algorithm (so-called NewOPE) solving posterior inference in topic models by combining Bernoulli distribution, stochastic bounds, and approximation function. Our algorithm has more attractive properties than existing inference approaches, including theoretical guarantees on quality and fast convergence rate. It not only maintains the key advantages of OPE but often outperforms OPE and existing algorithms before.

808,984,Reducing Class Overlapping in Supervised Dimension Reduction.,"Dimension reduction is to find a low-dimensional subspace to project high-dimensional data on, such that the discriminative property of the original higher-dimensional data is preserved. In supervised dimension reduction, class labels are integrated into the lower-dimensional representation, to produce better results on classification tasks. The supervised dimension reduction (SDR) framework by [17] is one of the state-of-the-art methods that takes into account not only the class labels but also the neighborhood graphs of the data, and have some advantages in preserving the within-class local structure and widening the between-class margin. However, the reduced-dimensional representation produced by the SDR framework suffers from the class overlapping problem - in which, data points lie closer to a different class rather than the class they belong to. The class overlapping problem can hurt the quality on the classification task. In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce the overlap for the SDR framework in [17]. The experimental results show that our method reduces the size of the overlapping set by an order of magnitude. As a result, our method outperforms the pre-existing framework on the classification task significantly. Moreover, visualization plots show that the reduced-dimensional representation learned by our method is more scattered for within-class data and more separated for between-class data, as compared to the pre-existing SDR framework.",42,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

While the accuracy of a classifier measures the ability to correctly classify unseen data, interpretability is the ability of the classifier to be understood by humans and provide reasons why each data instance is assigned to a label. This paper proposes an interpretable classification method by exploiting the Dirichlet process mixture model of von Mises–Fisher distributions for directional data. By using the labeled information of the training data explicitly and determining automatically the number of topics for each class, the learned topics are coherent, relevant and discriminative.

In this paper, we however point out that many existing approaches are prone to overfitting for extremely large/infinite datasets. The possibility of overfitting is particularly high in streaming environments. This finding suggests to use regularization for stochastic inference.

By using both terms (words) and biterms to represent documents, bag-of-biterms (BoB) provides significant benefits: (1) it naturally lengthens representation and thus helps us reduce bad effects of shortness; (2) it enables the posterior inference in a large class of probabilistic models including HDP to be less intractable; (3) no modification of existing models/methods is necessary, and thus BoB can be easily employed in a wide class of statistical models. To evaluate those benefits of BoB, we take Online HDP into account in that it can deal with dynamic and massive text collections, and we do experiments on three large corpora of short texts which are crawled from Twitter, Yahoo Q&A, and New York Times.

We use a mean-field variational inference algorithm when developing DLDPvMFs.

814,990,Modeling the diversity and log-normality of data.,"We investigate two important properties of real data: diversity and log-normality. Log-normality accounts for the fact that data follow the lognormal distribution, whereas diversity measures variations of the attributes in the data. To our knowledge, these two inherent properties have not been paid much attention from the machine learning community, especially from the topic modeling community. In this article, we fill in this gap in the framework of topic modeling. We first investigate whether or not these two properties can be captured by the most well-known Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (LDA), and find that LDA behaves inconsistently with respect to diversity. Particularly, it favors data of low diversity, but works badly on data of high diversity. Then, we argue that these two inherent properties can be captured well by endowing the topic-word distributions in LDA with the lognormal distribution. This treatment leads to a new model, named Dirichlet-lognormal topic model (DLN). Using the lognormal distribution complicates the learning and inference of DLN, compared with those of LDA. Hence, we used variational method, in which model learning and inference are reduced to solving convex optimization problems. Extensive experiments strongly suggest that (1) the predictive power of DLN is consistent with respect to diversity, and that (2) DLN works consistently better than LDA for datasets whose diversity is large, and for datasets which contain many log-normally distributed attributes. Justifications for these results require insights into the used statistical distributions and will be discussed in the article.",42,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach 
815,991,An effective framework for supervised dimension reduction.,"We consider supervised dimension reduction (SDR) for problems with discrete inputs. Existing methods are computationally expensive, and often do not take the local structure of data into consideration when searching for a low-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SDR with the aims that it can inherit scalability of existing unsupervised methods, and that it can exploit well label information and local structure of data when searching for a new space. The way we encode local information in this framework ensures three effects: preserving inner-class local structure, widening inter-class margin, and reducing possible overlap between classes. These effects are vital for success in practice. Such an encoding helps our framework succeed even in cases that data points reside in a nonlinear manifold, for which existing methods fail. The framework is general and flexible so that it can be easily adapted to various unsupervised topic models. We then adapt our framework to three unsupervised models which results in three methods for SDR. Extensive experiments on 10 practical domains demonstrate that our framework can yield scalable and qualitative methods for SDR.

816,992,Dual online inference for latent Dirichlet allocation.,"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) provides an efficient tool to analyze very large text collections. In this paper, we discuss three novel contributions: (1) a proof for the tractability of the MAP estimation of topic mixtures under certain conditions that might fit well with practices, even though the problem is known to be intractable in the worst case; (2) a provably fast algorithm (OFW) for inferring topic mixtures; (3) a dual online algorithm (DOLDA) for learning LDA at a large scale. We show that OFW converges to some local optima, but under certain conditions it can converge to global optima. The discussion of OFW is very general and hence can be readily employed to accelerate the MAP estimation in a wide class of probabilistic models. From extensive experiments we find that DOLDA can achieve significantly better predictive performance and more interpretable topics, with lower runtime, than stochastic variational inference. Further, DOLDA enables us to easily analyze text streams or millions of documents.",42,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

It is employed widely in different fields such as information retrieval, image processing, etc. After a decade of fast development, severe limitations still remained in NMFs methods including high complexity in instance inference, hard to control sparsity or to interpret the role of latent components. To deal with these limitations, this paper proposes a new formulation by adding simplicial constraints for NMF.

818,994,Probable convexity and its application to Correlated Topic Models.,"Non-convex optimization problems often arise from probabilistic modeling, such as estimation of posterior distributions. Non-convexity makes the problems intractable, and poses various obstacles for us to design efficient algorithms. In this work, we attack non-convexity by first introducing the concept of \emph{probable convexity} for analyzing convexity of real functions in practice. We then use the new concept to analyze an inference problem in the \emph{Correlated Topic Model} (CTM) and related nonconjugate models. Contrary to the existing belief of intractability, we show that this inference problem is concave under certain conditions. One consequence of our analyses is a novel algorithm for learning CTM which is significantly more scalable and qualitative than existing methods. Finally, we highlight that stochastic gradient algorithms might be a practical choice to resolve efficiently non-convex problems. This finding might find beneficial in many contexts which are beyond probabilistic modeling.",42,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Three key properties of the model are: (1) the inference algorithm converges in linear time, (2) learning of topics is simply a multiplication of two sparse matrices, (3) it provides a principled way to directly trade off sparsity of solutions against inference quality and running time. These properties enable us to speedily learn sparse topics and to infer sparse latent representations of documents, and help significantly save memory for storage. We show that inference in FSTM is actually MAP inference with an implicit prior. Extensive experiments show that FSTM can perform substantially better than various existing topic models by different performance measures. Finally, our parallel implementation can handily learn thousands of topics from large corpora with millions of terms.",42,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

In this article, we introduce a simple framework for inference in probabilistic topic models, denoted by FW. This framework is general and flexible enough to be easily adapted to mixture models. It has a linear convergence rate, offers an easy way to incorporate prior knowledge, and provides us an easy way to directly trade off sparsity against quality and time.

822,998,Adaptive Ranking Relevant Source Files for Bug Reports Using Genetic Algorithm.,"Precisely locating buggy files for a given bug report is a cumbersome and time-consuming task, particularly in a large-scale project with thousands of source files and bug reports. An efficient bug localization module is desirable to improve the productivity of the software maintenance phase. Many previous approaches rank source files according to their relevance to a given bug report based on simple lexical matching scores. However, the lexical mismatches between natural language expressions used to describe bug reports and technical terms of software source code might reduce the bug localization system’s accuracy. Incorporating domain knowledge through some features such as the semantic similarity, the fixing frequency of a source file, the code change history and similar bug reports is crucial to efficiently locating buggy files. In this paper, we propose a bug localization model, BugLocGA that leverages both lexical and semantic information as well as explores the relation between a bug report and a source file through some domain features. Given a bug report, we calculate the ranking score with every source files through a weighted sum of all features, where the weights are trained through a genetic algorithm with the aim of maximizing the performance of the bug localization model using two evaluation metrics: mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP). The empirical results conducted on some widely-used open source software projects have showed that our model outperformed some state of the art approaches by effectively recommending relevant files where the bug should be fixed.",44,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Reliability is also the main issue with computer systems. One of the purposes of system reliability analysis is to identify the weakness in a system and to quantify the impact of component failures. However, existing reliability prediction approaches for component-based software systems are limited in their applicability because they either neglect or do not support modeling explicitly several factors like error propagation, software fault tolerance mechanisms. In this paper, we evaluate reliability prediction of component-based system and fault tolerance structures technique by applying Pham Nordmann Zhang (PNZ) model, one of the best models based on non homogeneous Poisson process. Our approach uses a reliability modeling schema whose models are automatically transformed by a reliability prediction tool into PNZ models for reliability predictions and sensitivity analyses. Via these our case studies, we demonstrate its applicability and introduce how much reliability of software system can be improved by using fault tolerance structures technique.",45,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

This problem is the so-called inverse connected p-median problem on block graphs. We consider the problem on a block graph with uniform edge lengths under various cost functions, say rectilinear norm, Chebyshev norm, and bottleneck Hamming distance. To solve the problem, we first find an optimality criterion for a set that is a connected p-median. Based on this criterion, we can formulate the problem as a convex or quasiconvex univariate optimization problem. Finally, we develop combinatorial algorithms that solve the problems under the three cost functions in O(nlogn) time, where n is the number of vertices in the underlying block graph.",45,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

By this result, we further explore the characteristic of the optimal solution, which helps to develop a linear time algorithm to solve the constrained 2-maxian problem. The result can be extended to the constrained p-maxian on trees based on the nestedness property.

For the inverse 1-median problem, we develop a linear time algorithm based on the optimal solution of the induced unconstrained problem. For the inverse 1-center problem, we prove that the problem can be decomposed into linearly many subproblems and the objective function in each subproblem is piecewise-convex.

While the demand of this crop is increasing overtime, the land use for this purpose is restricted due to various factors such as urban expansion and seawater intrusion. Therefore, a sustainable and effective rice paddy area monitoring is highly desirable, as the traditional methods are costly, inaccurate and requires heavy human-related workload. In this paper, we propose a novel rice monitoring framework using the satellite image, thanks to its high quality and free-to-access. Our framework first preprocesses the raw satellite image to alleviate the effect of adversarial factors such as geometric discrepancy and solar radiation. Then we design a deep learning model inspiring from u-net architecture to exploit simultaneously the spatial, spectral and temporal nature of satellite images. The empirical result conducted over data collected in Vietnamese Mekong Delta shows that our framework outperforms others state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the accuracy of 92.7% without the need of any handcraft feature engineering or expert knowledge.",45,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

831,1008,Severity Detection Tool for Patients with Infectious Disease.,"Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and tetanus are serious infectious diseases in low and middle income countries. Tetanus in particular has a high mortality rate and its treatment is resource-demanding. Furthermore, HFMD often affects a large number of infants and young children. As a result, its treatment consumes enormous healthcare resources, especially when outbreaks occur. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD) is the main cause of death for both HFMD and tetanus patients. However, early detection of ANSD is a difficult and challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to provide a proof-of-principle to detect the ANSD level automatically by applying machine learning techniques to physiological patient data, such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms, which can be collected using low-cost wearable sensors. Efficient features are extracted that encode variations in the waveforms in the time and frequency domains. A support vector machine is employed to classify the ANSD levels. The proposed approach is validated on multiple datasets of HFMD and tetanus patients in Vietnam. Results show that encouraging performance is achieved in classifying ANSD levels. Moreover, the proposed features are simple, more generalisable and outperformed the standard heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The proposed approach would facilitate both the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in low and middle income countries, and thereby improve overall patient care.",45,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

The system focuses on the mechanisms of how to detect the current position of each vehicle and to navigate each vehicle. Individual vehicular data is collected using the Global Positioning System - GPS, for location data and it will then be transmitted to a control center via a mobile phone. For the purpose of this paper, the device will be referred to as “Reporting Equipment for current geographic Position” or REP. It is suspected that if a great number of REP equipped vehicles report their positions to the control center simultaneously, there would be a heavy load on the computational communications network (“network”). This paper proposes an algorithm to reduce the network load associated with large numbers of vehicles reporting their position at the same time; if a car skips some reports then it is not possible for the control center to estimate its correct position therefore we need an algorithm that aims to decrease the frequency of the reporting without sacrificing the proper level of accuracy for the position.

Despite achievements in optical character recognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent problems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing approaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks. However, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow training speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as vanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity and performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based neural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to overcome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss instead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency samples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts, we exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to the recognition network.

Such particles can penetrate deep into the human lungs and severely affect human health. This paper studies accurate PM2.5 prediction, which can potentially contribute to reducing or avoiding the negative consequences. Our approach’s novelty is to utilize the genetic algorithm (GA) and an encoder-decoder (E-D) model for PM2.5 prediction. The GA benefits feature selection and remove outliers to enhance the prediction accuracy. The encoder-decoder model with long short-term memory (LSTM), which relaxes the restrictions between the input and output of the model, can be used to effectively predict the PM2.5 concentration. We evaluate the proposed model on air quality datasets from Hanoi and Taiwan. The evaluation results show that our model achieves excellent performance. By merely using the E-D model, we can obtain more accurate (up to 53.7%) predictions than those of previous works. Moreover, the GA in our model has the advantage of obtaining the optimal feature combination for predicting the PM2.5 concentration.

Aiming to solve these problems, in this work, we propose a novel geographic routing protocol for WSNs, namely, Q-learning Inspired Hole bypassing (QIH), which is lightweight and efficient. QIH’s conceptual idea is to leverage Q-learning to estimate the distance from a node to the holes. QIH makes routing decisions following the nodes’ residual energy, their estimated distance to the holes, and their distance to the destination.

In such a context, designing a charging strategy that optimally prolongs the network lifetime is challenging. This work aims to solve the challenges by introducing a novel, on-demand charging algorithm for MC that attempts to maximize the network lifetime, where the term “network lifetime” is defined by the interval from when the network starts till the first target is not monitored by any sensor. The algorithm, named Fuzzy Q-charging, optimizes both the time and location in which the MC performs its charging tasks. Fuzzy Q-charging uses Fuzzy logic to determine the optimal charging-energy amounts for sensors. From that, we propose a method to find the optimal charging time at each charging location. Fuzzy Q-charging leverages Q-learning to determine the next charging location for maximizing the network lifetime. To this end, Q-charging prioritizes the sensor nodes following their roles and selects a suitable charging location where MC provides sufficient power for the prioritized sensors. We have extensively evaluated the effectiveness of Fuzzy Q-charging in comparison to the related works. The evaluation results show that Fuzzy Q-charging outperforms the others. First, Fuzzy Q-charging can guarantee an infinite lifetime in the WSRNs, which have a sufficient large sensor number or a commensurate target number. Second, in other cases, Fuzzy Q-charging can extend the time until the first target is not monitored by 6.8 times on average and 33.9 times in the best case, compared to existing algorithms.",45,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Moreover, an RSU can also offload to gNB, forming three offloading paths: vehicle-to-RSU, vehicle-to-gNB, and RSU-to-gNB. This paper aims to minimize the offloaded tasks' average latency while dealing with the network dynamic. Note that the existing works assume the fixed network parameters, hence have failed to address the dynamic. As a solution, we use the multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MBA) learning for offloading that can adapt to the network dynamic and optimize the latency. More importantly, we propose a new MBA offloading scheme with an exploration mechanism based on the Sigmoid function. We conduct an extensive evaluation to evaluate and show the superiority of our proposal. First, the proposed Sigmoid exploration mechanism reduces the tasks' average latency by 35% compared to a basic MBA using negative rewarding.

The accurate forecast of the two has long been a challenge in hydrological researches and flood prediction. While the traditional statistical models fail to capture the peak discharge during flooding seasons (i.e., due to the excessive level values), the simulation’s numerical models face the difficulty of precise input parameters (e.g., measured values of surface zones, root zones, etc.). The emerging deep learning shows a lot of potential in solving the challenges of Q and H prediction. However, applying deep learning in such a context is not straightforward due to the following critical issues. First, the amount of training data is insufficient due to the data collection is non-trivial. Second, although lacking, the collected data incurs noises (e.g., measurement errors). We aim to overcome those shortcomings in a newly proposed deep learning model that accurately predicts Q and H. The model is a new ensemble of the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), long short term memory (LSTM) models, to handle the insufficient data issue.

846,1024,MC-OCR Challenge 2021: A Multi-modal Approach for Mobile-Captured Vietnamese Receipts Recognition.,"Mobile captured receipts OCR (MC-OCR) recognizes text from structured and semi-structured receipts and invoices captured by mobile devices. This process plays a critical role in streamlining document-intensive processes and office automation in many financial, accounting, and taxation areas. Although many efforts have been devoted, MC-OCR still faces significant challenges due to mobile captured images’ complexity. First, receipts might be crumpled, or the content might be blurred. Second, different from scanned images, the quality of photos taken by mobile devices shows high diversity due to the light condition and the dynamic environment (e.g., indoor, out-door, complex background, etc.) where the receipts were captured. These difficulties lead to a low accuracy of the recognition results. In this challenge, we target two tasks to address these issues, including (1) evaluating the quality of the captured receipts, and (2) recognizing required fields of the receipts. Our idea is to leverage a multi-modal approach which can take advantage of both areas: computer vision and natural language processing, two of the main interests of the RIVF community.

However, traditional monitoring requires field works or surveys performed by experts, which is costly, slow, and sparse. Agriculture monitoring systems are looking for sustainable land use monitoring solutions, starting with remote sensing on satellite data for cheap and timely paddy mapping. The aim of this study is to develop an autonomous and intelligent system built on top of imagery data streams, which is available from low-Earth orbiting satellites, to differentiate crop areas from non-crop areas. However, such agriculture mapping framework poses unique challenges for satellite image processing, including the seasonal nature of crop, the complexity of spectral channels, and adversarial conditions such as cloud and solar radiance.

848,1026,Automated Test Input Generation via Model Inference Based on User Story and Acceptance Criteria for Mobile Application Development.,"There has been observed explosive growth in the development of mobile applications (apps) for Android and iOS operating systems, which has led to the direct impact towards mobile app development. In order to design and propose quality-oriented apps, it is the primary responsibility of developers to devote time and sufficient efforts towards testing to make the apps bug-free and operational in the hands of end-users without any hiccup. Manual testing procedures take a prolonged amount of time in writing test cases, and in some cases, the full testing requirements are not met. Besides, the insufficient knowledge of tester also impacts the overall quality and bug-free apps. To overcome the obstacles of testing, we propose a new testing methodology cum tool called “AgileUATM” which works primarily towards white-box and black-box testing. To evaluate the validity of the proposed tool, we put the tool in a real-time operational environment concerning mobile test apps. By using this tool, all the acceptance criteria are determined via user stories. The testers/developers specify requirements with formal specifications based on programs properties, predicates, invariants, and constraints. The results show that the proposed tool generated effective and accurate test cases, test input. Meanwhile, expected output was also generated in a unified fashion from the user stories to meet acceptance criteria. The proposed solution also reduced the development time to identify test data as compared to manual Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. This tool can support the developers to get a better idea about the required tests and able to translate the customer’s natural languages to computer languages as well. This paper fulfills an approach to suitably test mobile application development",45,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

To this end, this paper proposes a new geographic routing protocol for WSNs named the load Balanced and constant Stretch protocol for bypassing Multiple Holes (i.e., BSMH). In contrast to the existing works in the literature, the design of BSMH simultaneously takes into account the three factors that impacted the network lifetime, including routing path length, control packet overhead, and load balance among the nodes. Moreover, BSMH aims at minimizing the routing path length and the control overhead, while maximizing the load balance. We theoretically prove the efficiency of BSMH and extensively evaluate BSMH against the state-of-the-art protocols. The evaluation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms the others in various investigated metrics, not only network lifetime, but also routing path stretch, load balance, and control overhead. Specifically, BSMH prolongs the network lifetime by 30% compared to the existing protocols while guaranteeing that the routing path stretch is under",45,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

As a solution, we introduce a novel on-demand charging scheme for WRSNs that optimize the charging time at each MC's charging location. Moreover, we take advantage of the Q-learning technique (i.e., hence named our algorithms Q-charging) to maximize the number of monitored targets. Q-charging can prioritize the sensor nodes, which play a more critical role in the network. Hence, Q-charging can select a suitable charging location aiming to provide sufficient power for the prioritized sensors. We have evaluated our proposal in comparison to the previous works.

In this paper, we first formulate the problem under linear programming model which can help to determine the exact optimal solution. Then, in order to reduce the time complexity, we propose a (1 +∊)-approximation algorithm based on divide-and-conquer technique. The main idea is to divide the network into sub-regions, then determine the suboptimal solution for every sub-region and combine them to obtain the total solution of the whole network.

However, with the occurrence of holes, geographic routing incurs with the so-called local minimum problem that may lead to a long hole detour path as well as the traffic concentration around the hole boundary. In consequence, the network lifetime is shortened. In this paper, we aim at proposing a lightweight distributed geographic routing protocol, which can prolong the lifetime of WSNs under the hole occurrence. Our main idea is to exploiting Q-learning technique to estimate the distance from a node to the holes. The routing decision is then determined based on the residual energy of the nodes, their estimated distance to the holes, and their distance to the destination.

However, none of them jointly considers all of these factors, thus they can not solve the network lifetime maximization problem thoroughly. In this paper, we aim at designing a routing protocol whose objective is to minimize the routing path length and the control overhead, while maximizing the load balance.

With the occurrence of holes, however, geographic routing faces the problems of load imbalance and routing path enlargement. In the literature, several proposals have attempted to fix these issues, but the majority of them considers only the cases when both the source and the destination stay fairly far from the holes. Recently, a few work has been proposed to tackle the problem of routing in the vicinity of routing holes. However, none of them addresses the two problems (i.e., load imbalance and routing path enlargement) concurrently, and none of them can solve the problem of load imbalance thoroughly. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach in dealing with routing in the vicinity of holes, that is the first to target and solve both the load imbalance and path enlargement problems. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of our proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1 + ε (for any predefined ε> 0) and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms the existing protocols in terms of load balancing.",45,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
858,1036,A Delay-Guaranteed Geographic Routing Protocol with Hole Avoidance in WSNs.,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in many mission-critical applications, such as target tracking on a battlefield, emergency alarms, and disaster detection. In such applications, QoS provisioning in the timeliness domain is indispensable. Moreover, because of the diversity of sensory data, QoS provisioning should support not only one but multiple levels of end-to-end delay constraints. As a result of several characteristics such as the limitations on the energy supply, available storage and computational capacity of the sensor nodes, guaranteeing timely delivery in WSNs is a challenging problem. To overcome these limitations, several lightweight and stateless QoS-based geographic routing protocols have been proposed. The existing protocols work well in networks without routing holes (i.e., regions with no working sensors). However, with the occurrence of routing holes, they suffer from the so-called local minimum phenomenon and traffic congestion around the hole boundary. In this paper, we consider the presence of routing holes and propose a delay-guaranteed geographic routing protocol called DEHA that can support multiple end-to-end delay levels. The main idea is to achieve early awareness of the presence of a routing hole and then to utilize this awareness in determining a routing path that can avoid the hole. Simulation results show that our protocol outperforms the existing protocols in terms of several performance metrics, including packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, and load balancing.",45,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
859,1037,Constant stretch and load balanced routing protocol for bypassing multiple holes in wireless sensor networks.,"The occurrence of multiple holes in wireless sensor networks poses many challenges in designing routing protocols. The traditional scheme is forwarding packets along the hole perimeters. However, this scheme leads to two serious problems: data concentration around the hole boundaries and routing path enlargement Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address these two problems, wherein a common idea is to form forbidden areas around the holes from which packets are kept to stay away. However, due to the static nature of the forbidden areas and routing paths, the existing protocols cannot solve these two problems thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for bypassing multiple holes in wireless sensor networks which can balance the traffic over the network while ensuring the constant stretch property of the routing path. Our main idea is to use elastic forbidden areas and dynamic routing paths. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of the proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1 + ϵ (for any predefined ϵ > 0), and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in terms of load balancing.",45,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Components and their interactions are described in the BIP language. Global invariants of composite components are obtained by combining local invariants of their constituent components with interaction invariants that take interactions into account. We study new techniques for computing interaction invariants. Some of these techniques are incremental, i.e., interaction invariants of a composite hierarchically structured component are computed by reusing invariants of its constituents. We formalize incremental construction of components in the BIP language as the process of building progressively complex components by adding interactions (synchronization constraints) to atomic components. We provide sufficient conditions ensuring preservation of invariants when new interactions are added. When these conditions are not satisfied, we propose methods for generating new invariants in an incremental manner by reusing existing invariants from the constituents in the incremental construction. The reuse of existing invariants reduces considerably the overall verification effort. The techniques have been implemented in the D-Finder toolset. Among the experiments conducted, we have been capable of verifying safety properties and deadlock-freedom of sub-systems of the functional level of the DALA autonomous robot.

Previous work has shown that approximating the state space of component based systems by computing invariants allows to verify much larger systems then standard methods that compute the exact state space. The approach comes with the drawback, though, that not all of the reported specification violations may be reachable in the system. This paper deals with that problem by combining the information from the invariant with model checking techniques and strategies for reducing the memory footprint.

Interaction invariants are global constraints on the states of components involved in interactions.

870,1049,Invariants and Robustness of BIP Models.,"In this paper we present on-going work addressing the problem of automatically generating realistic and guaranteed correct invariants. Since invariant generation mechanisms are error-prone, after the computation of invariants by a verification tool, we formally prove that the generated invariants are indeed invariants of the considered systems using a higher-order theorem prover and automated techniques. We regard invariants for BIP models. BIP (behavior, interaction, priority) is a language for specifying asynchronous component based systems. Proving that an invariant holds often requires an induction on possible system execution traces. For this reason, apart from generating invariants that precisely capture a system’s behavior, inductiveness of invariants is an important goal. We establish a notion of robust BIP models. These can be automatically constructed from our original non-robust BIP models and over-approximate their behavior. We motivate that invariants of robust BIP models capture the behavior of systems in a more natural way than invariants of corresponding non-robust BIP models. Robust BIP models take imprecision due to values delivered by sensors into account. Invariants of robust BIP models tend to be inductive and are also invariants of the original non-robust BIP model. Therefore they may be used by our verification tools and it is easy to show their correctness in a higher-order theorem prover. The presented work is developed to verify the results of a deadlock-checking tool for embedded systems after their computations. Therewith, we gain confidence in the provided analysis results.",45,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

877,1056,A bi-level optimized charging algorithm for energy depletion avoidance in wireless rechargeable sensor networks.,"In Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks (WRSNs), charging scheme optimization is one of the most critical issues, which plays an essential role in deciding the sensors’ lifetime. An effective charging scheme should simultaneously consider both the charging path and the charging time. Existing works, however, mainly focus on determining the optimal charging path and adopt the full charging strategy. The full charging approach may increase the sensors’ charging delay and eventually lead to sensor energy depletion. This paper studies how to optimize the charging path and the charging time at the same time to avoid energy depletion in WRSNs. We first formulate the investigated problem with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model. We then leverage the bi-level optimization approach and represent the targeted problem with two levels: the charging path optimization at the upper level and the charging time optimization at the lower level. A combination of Genetic Algorithm and Greedy method is proposed to determine the optimal charging path.

880,1059,Usability and Aesthetics: Better Together for Automated Repair of Web Pages.,"With the recent explosive growth of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, guaranteeing consistent web appearance across all environments has become a significant problem. This happens simply because it is hard to keep track of the web appearance on different sizes and types of devices that render the web pages. Therefore, fixing the inconsistent appearance of web pages can be difficult, and the cost incurred can be huge, e.g., poor user experience and financial loss due to it. Recently, automated web repair techniques have been proposed to automatically resolve inconsistent web page appearance, focusing on improving usability. However, generated patches tend to disrupt the webpage's layout, rendering the repaired webpage aesthetically unpleasing, e.g., distorted images or misalignment of components. In this paper, we propose an automated repair approach for web pages based on meta-heuristic algorithms that can assure both usability and aesthetics.

881,1060,SAFL: A Self-Attention Scene Text Recognizer with Focal Loss.,"In the last decades, scene text recognition has gained worldwide attention from both the academic community and actual users due to its importance in a wide range of applications. Despite achievements in optical character recognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent problems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing approaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks. However, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow training speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as vanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity and performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based neural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to overcome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss instead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency samples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts, we exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to the recognition network. We perform experiments to compare the performance of the proposed model with seven benchmarks. The numerical results show that our model achieves the best performance.",49,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

These issues may degrade the network lifetime of WSNs since they cause a long detour path and a traffic concentration around the hole boundary. Aiming to solve these problems, in this work, we propose a novel geographic routing protocol for WSNs, namely, Q-learning Inspired Hole bypassing (QIH), which is lightweight and efficient. QIH’s conceptual idea is to leverage Q-learning to estimate the distance from a node to the holes. QIH makes routing decisions following the nodes’ residual energy, their estimated distance to the holes, and their distance to the destination. We first confirm the effectiveness of QIH by theoretical analysis. Then, we conduct extensive simulations of QIH in comparison to state-of-the-art protocols. The simulation results show that QIH outperforms the other protocols in terms of network lifetime, packet latency, and energy consumption.",49,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
883,1062,Realizing Mobile Air Quality Monitoring System: Architectural Concept and Device Prototype.,"Air pollution is a critical issue in cities in developing countries like Hanoi, Vietnam. An efficient and comprehensive air quality monitoring system may reduce the harmfulness and improve the cities' sustainability. This paper presents a novel approach to realize such a system in which the air monitoring sensors are mobile. More specifically, we introduce a three-tier architecture for the air quality system, including sensing, communication, and application layers. Initially, we discuss each layer concept to bypass the limitation of the traditional stationary monitoring system. We then describe our design and implementation of air quality monitoring devices installed on vehicles, such as buses. The device is carefully designed to satisfy the conditions of impedance matching and power integrity. Besides, it fully functions in measuring parameters from the ambient environment. The device is aware of its location (using GPS) and uses Wi-Fi and 4G (LTE) to transmit sensing data on the Internet. We have conducted various experiments, including a trial deployment of the devices on a vehicle running in Hanoi. The results show our device achieves sensing data transmission with high-reliability levels (i.e., 97%, 100% on Wi-Fi, 4G (LTE), respectively). Moreover, the trial deployment confirms the feasible operation of our device in actual condition.",49,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
884,1063,Speaker count: A new building block for speaker diarization.,"In daily communication, several people sometimes talk simultaneously, resulting in overlapped speech segments. Such segments challenge machine listening tasks like speaker diarization or speech recognition. This paper presents a speaker diarization framework where speaker count, a building block to predict the number of active speakers in each analyzing audio window, is integrated. Such speaker count block can be developed independently with existing speaker diarization systems; its output is then used in the re-segmentation step of existing systems to better label active speakers in each considered window. We further investigate the effect of analyzing window size in diarization performance in an oracle setting. Our preliminary theoretical analysis shows that the overlap speech detection, a special case of speaker count, is helpful to reduce diarization error rate when the window size is small enough. Finally, experiment results obtained from two state-of-the-art diarization systems on a benchmark dataset confirm the potential benefit of the proposed approach.",49,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
885,1064,Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandit Learning for Offloading Delay Minimization in V2X Networks.,"In a three-tier Vehicle to X (V2X) network, a vehicle can offload the computational tasks to the edge computing component at a roadside unit (RSU) or a base station with cloud computing (gNB). Moreover, an RSU can also offload to gNB, forming three offloading paths: vehicle-to-RSU, vehicle-to-gNB, and RSU-to-gNB. This paper aims to minimize the offloaded tasks' average latency while dealing with the network dynamic. Note that the existing works assume the fixed network parameters, hence have failed to address the dynamic. As a solution, we use the multi-agent multi-armed bandits (MBA) learning for offloading that can adapt to the network dynamic and optimize the latency. More importantly, we propose a new MBA offloading scheme with an exploration mechanism based on the Sigmoid function. We conduct an extensive evaluation to evaluate and show the superiority of our proposal. First, the proposed Sigmoid exploration mechanism reduces the tasks' average latency by 35% compared to a basic MBA using negative rewarding. Second, the simulation results show our proposed offloading algorithm shortens the task latency by 18.5% on average and 56.9% in the best case, compared to the state-of-the-art.",49,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

In the networking fields, missing data prevents advanced analysis and downgrades downstream applications such as traffic engineering and anomaly detection. Despite the great potential, existing imputation approaches based on tensor decomposition and deep learning techniques have shown limitations in addressing missing values of traffic data due to its dynamic behavior. In this paper, we propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for Imputing Network Traffic (GCRINT), a combination between Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Neural Network, for filling the missing values of network traffic data. We use a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network and Graph Neural Network to efficiently learn the spatial-temporal correlations in partially observed data. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our model by using two different datasets and various missing scenarios. The experiment results show that GCRINT achieves significantly low imputation errors and reduces the error by 35% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. GCRINT also helps to obtain a stable performance in the traffic engineering problem.",49,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
887,1066,Efficient Prediction of Discharge and Water Levels Using Ensemble Learning and Singular-Spectrum Analysis-Based Denoising.,"This work addresses forecasting two essential factors in river hydrodynamics, which are discharge (Q) and water (H) levels. The accurate forecast of the two has long been a challenge in hydrological researches and flood prediction. While the traditional statistical models fail to capture the peak discharge during flooding seasons (i.e., due to the excessive level values), the simulation’s numerical models face the difficulty of precise input parameters (e.g., measured values of surface zones, root zones, etc.). The emerging deep learning shows a lot of potential in solving the challenges of Q and H prediction. However, applying deep learning in such a context is not straightforward due to the following critical issues. First, the amount of training data is insufficient due to the data collection is non-trivial. Second, although lacking, the collected data incurs noises (e.g., measurement errors). We aim to overcome those shortcomings in a newly proposed deep learning model that accurately predicts Q and H. The model is a new ensemble of the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), long short term memory (LSTM) models, to handle the insufficient data issue. Moreover, we adopt the Singular-Spectrum Analysis technique to eliminate noise from the collected data. The experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods.",49,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

To this end, Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a potential solution that utilizes the idle resources of vehicles to reduce the load imposed on the edge servers. In this paper, we leverage the advantages of both deep reinforcement learning and Fuzzy logic to propose Fuzzy Deep Q-learning base Offloading scheme (FDQO), a real-time offloading scheme in delay constrained VFC. Our objective is to maximize the Quality of Experiences (QoE), which indicates how the task meets its delay constraint. The experiment results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing algorithms.

889,1068,Multi-time-step Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering Leveraging Traffic Prediction.,"Based on the concept of source routing, Segment Routing (SR) allows the source or ingress node to inject a sequence of segment labels into the packet header and specify the routing path. Due to the routing flexibility, SR has been widely used to solve traffic engineering problems such as minimizing the maximum link utilization. However, most of the prior works only solve the problem in a single snapshot without considering network traffic dynamics, resulting in frequent traffic reroute. To cope with this problem, we focus on solving the segment routing based traffic engineering problem by taking into account the future traffic changes. We formulate the multi-time-step segment routing problem and leverage traffic prediction to extend the length of routing cycles. Due to the large search space of multi-time-step segment routing problem, we further propose a heuristic algorithm for incrementally recomputing the segment routing paths in sub-second. Through extensive experiments on real backbone network traffic datasets, we show that our proposal can achieve a near-optimal performance in term of maximum link utilization while significantly reducing the number of routing changes.",49,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

We aim to reduce 4G costs while assuring data latency, where the data latency is defined as the amount of time it takes for data to reach the server. We propose an offloading scheme that leverages Q-learning to accomplish the purpose. The experiment results show that our offloading method significantly cuts down around 40-50% of the 4G communication cost while keeping the latency of 99.5% packets smaller than the required threshold.",49,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Humans with normal hearing ability can easily locate, identify and differentiate sound sources which are heard simultaneously. However, this is an extremely difficult task for machines as the creation of machine listening algorithms that can automatically separate sound sources in difficult mixing conditions has remained very challenging. In this paper, we consider the use of a visual-guided audio source separation approach for separating sounds of different instruments in the video, where detected visual objects are used to assist the sound separation process. We particularly investigate the use of different object detectors for the task. In addition, as an empirical study, we analyze the effect of training datasets on separation performance.

892,1071,MC-OCR Challenge 2021: A Multi-modal Approach for Mobile-Captured Vietnamese Receipts Recognition.,"Mobile captured receipts OCR (MC-OCR) recognizes text from structured and semi-structured receipts and invoices captured by mobile devices. This process plays a critical role in streamlining document-intensive processes and office automation in many financial, accounting, and taxation areas. Although many efforts have been devoted, MC-OCR still faces significant challenges due to mobile captured images’ complexity. First, receipts might be crumpled, or the content might be blurred. Second, different from scanned images, the quality of photos taken by mobile devices shows high diversity due to the light condition and the dynamic environment (e.g., indoor, out-door, complex background, etc.) where the receipts were captured. These difficulties lead to a low accuracy of the recognition results. In this challenge, we target two tasks to address these issues, including (1) evaluating the quality of the captured receipts, and (2) recognizing required fields of the receipts. Our idea is to leverage a multi-modal approach which can take advantage of both areas: computer vision and natural language processing, two of the main interests of the RIVF community.

In contrast to the existing works in the literature, the design of BSMH simultaneously takes into account the three factors that impacted the network lifetime, including routing path length, control packet overhead, and load balance among the nodes. Moreover, BSMH aims at minimizing the routing path length and the control overhead, while maximizing the load balance. We theoretically prove the efficiency of BSMH and extensively evaluate BSMH against the state-of-the-art protocols. The evaluation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms the others in various investigated metrics, not only network lifetime, but also routing path stretch, load balance, and control overhead. Specifically, BSMH prolongs the network lifetime by 30% compared to the existing protocols while guaranteeing that the routing path stretch is under",49,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

In general, providing power to ensure the computing power of edge servers in the MEC network is very important. In many cases, ensuring continuous power supply to the system is not possible because servers are deployed in hard-to-reach areas such as outlying areas, forests, islands, etc. This is when renewable energy prevails as a viable source of power for ensuring stable operation. This paper addresses resource provisioning in the MEC network using renewable energy.

Thus, the test data is usually either gathered manually by the testers or randomly generated by tools. The manual method consumes lot of time and highly depends on the testers’ experience while the random approach faces the problem of redundant test data caused by identical use cases. By leveraging the concept of Model-based testing, this paper provides a novel method of testing to save the cost of manual testing and to increase the reliability of the testing processes. In Model-based testing, test cases and test data can be derived from different models. In this paper, we present a technique to generate test data from UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) presentation model for web application testing by using formal specification and Z3 SMT solver.

902,1081,A Delay-Guaranteed Geographic Routing Protocol with Hole Avoidance in WSNs.,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in many mission-critical applications, such as target tracking on a battlefield, emergency alarms, and disaster detection. In such applications, QoS provisioning in the timeliness domain is indispensable. Moreover, because of the diversity of sensory data, QoS provisioning should support not only one but multiple levels of end-to-end delay constraints. As a result of several characteristics such as the limitations on the energy supply, available storage and computational capacity of the sensor nodes, guaranteeing timely delivery in WSNs is a challenging problem. To overcome these limitations, several lightweight and stateless QoS-based geographic routing protocols have been proposed. The existing protocols work well in networks without routing holes (i.e., regions with no working sensors). However, with the occurrence of routing holes, they suffer from the so-called local minimum phenomenon and traffic congestion around the hole boundary. In this paper, we consider the presence of routing holes and propose a delay-guaranteed geographic routing protocol called DEHA that can support multiple end-to-end delay levels. The main idea is to achieve early awareness of the presence of a routing hole and then to utilize this awareness in determining a routing path that can avoid the hole.

903,1082,Constant stretch and load balanced routing protocol for bypassing multiple holes in wireless sensor networks.,"The occurrence of multiple holes in wireless sensor networks poses many challenges in designing routing protocols. The traditional scheme is forwarding packets along the hole perimeters. However, this scheme leads to two serious problems: data concentration around the hole boundaries and routing path enlargement Recently, several approaches have been proposed to address these two problems, wherein a common idea is to form forbidden areas around the holes from which packets are kept to stay away. However, due to the static nature of the forbidden areas and routing paths, the existing protocols cannot solve these two problems thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for bypassing multiple holes in wireless sensor networks which can balance the traffic over the network while ensuring the constant stretch property of the routing path. Our main idea is to use elastic forbidden areas and dynamic routing paths. The theoretical analysis proves that the routing path stretch of the proposed protocol can be controlled to be as small as 1 + ϵ (for any predefined ϵ > 0), and the simulation experiments show that our protocol strongly outperforms state-of-the-art protocols in terms of load balancing.",49,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Determining the location and shape of holes can help to monitor these disasters (such as volcano, tsunami, etc.) or help to make smart, early routing decisions for circumventing a hole. There are many hole determination algorithms proposed in the literature, however, these only consider the networks with static holes i.e. with stable boundary nodes. Moreover, most of these are designed in a centralized manner which is not suitable to the unstable situation of networks with an expanding hole. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic scheme not only for determining the initial shape but also for monitoring and quickly reporting about the area of a hole gradually expanding.

However, a finer approximation (for smaller stretch) leads to higher cost of dissemination, which could be unaffordable for the sensors. We provide an insightful analysis to this fundamental trade-off of the hole approximation problem, using a geometric model. Based on this we discuss an efficient approximation-dissemination scheme using a natural, heuristic approximation technique. For reasonable conditions (network is dense enough apart from the hole), we assure that the routing stretch is under a predefined threshold > 1 while the dissemination cost is also under tight control.

To normalize raw text with a number of non-standard words (NSWs), a two-step model is proposed. The first step involves classifying NSWs into different categories using Random Forest. The latter one is to expand them, depending on their NSW types, into pronounceable syllables using a hybrid method. Most of numeric types can be expanded by well-defined rules while most of alphabetic ones must be expanded by a deep learning (i.e. sequence-to-sequence) model and a post adjustment. The experiment on a Vietnamese corpus with proposed NSW categories shows that the most ambiguous cases of the classification model are for abbreviation and read-as-sequence types, hence combined into one category for the latter expansion with more complex model and better context. The classification model gives an enhanced result of 99.20% with the category combination and the feature optimization. In the expansion, the sequence-to-sequence model shows a good result of 96.53% for abbreviations and 96.25% for loanwords with a post-adjustment for some completely wrong cases.

As a state-of-the-art method for abstractive summarization, the pointer-generator network produces more fluent summaries and solves two shortcomings of reproducing factual details inaccurately and phrase repetition. Though this network can generate Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words, it cannot completely represent them in the context and may face the information loss problem. This paper aims to improve the quality of abstractive summarization with an extra pretrained layer of word embedding for the pointer-generator network. This mechanism helps to maintain the meaning of words in more various contexts. This assures that every word has its own representation, even though it does not exist in the vocabulary. We modify the network with the two latest word embedding mechanisms, i.e. Word2vec and Fasttext, to represent the semantic information of words more accurately. Some OOV words which are marked as unknown tokens now can have their right embeddings and be well considered in summary generation.

Experimental results showed that when NMF was combined three types of sentence features (i.e., surface, content, and relevant features) and word2vec, the system got best performance with 42.34% for Rouge-1 and 10.77% for Rouge-2, increasing 0.67% Rouge-1 and 0.78% Rouge-2 in compared with only NMF.",50,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
911,1091,Sender - Receiver cooperation and buffer observation for fine-grained adaptive transmission of video over mobile ad hoc networks.,"Deployment of video communication services over mobile ad hoc networks faces numerical obstacles since the networks are characterized by limited and unpredictable bandwidth. Following the tenet of service-orientation, this study proposes a cross-layer design for fine-grained adaptive transmission of real-time video over time-varying channels. Specifically, the sender accurately estimates the current effective bandwidth by observing its transmission buffer and negative acknowledgments (NACKs) from the receiver. Information on route quality provided by routing protocols may also be exploited to control the real-time stream efficiently. At the same time, the sender handles NACK messages to predict route goodness and orders retransmissions for improving video quality. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed design by both simulations and experiments of ad hoc nodes delivering H264/AVC, which consistently demonstrated the soundness and feasibility of the framework with respect to video quality and resource utilization.",50,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

913,1093,Prosodic Boundary Prediction Model for Vietnamese Text-To-Speech.,"This research aims to build a prosodic boundary prediction model for improving the naturalness of Vietnamese speech synthesis. This model can be used directly to predict prosodic boundaries in the synthesis phase of the statistical parametric or end-to-end speech systems. Beside conventional features related to Part-Of-Speech (POS), this paper proposes two efficient features to predict prosodic boundaries: syntactic blocks and syntactic links, based on a thorough analysis of a Vietnamese dataset. Syntactic blocks are syntactic phrases whose sizes are bounded in their constituent syntactic tree. A syntactic link of two adjacent words is calculated based on the distance between them in the syntax tree. The experimental results show that the two proposed predictors improve the quality of the boundary prediction model using a decision tree classification algorithm, about 36.4% (F1 score) higher than the model with only POS features. The final boundary prediction model with POS, syntactic block, and syntactic link features using the LightGBM algorithm gives the best F1-score results at 87.0% in test data. The proposed model helps the TTS systems, developed by either HMM-based, DNN-based, or End-to-end speech synthesis techniques, improve about 0.3 MOS points (i.e. 6 to 10%) compared to the ones without the proposed model.",50,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
914,1094,A Hypercuboid-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Malware Classification.,"Malware attacks have been among the most serious threats to cyber security in the last decade. Antimalware software can help safeguard information systems and minimize their exposure to the malware. Most of anti-malware programs detect malware instances based on signature or pattern matching. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to automatically detect models and patterns behind different types of malware variants. However, traditional machine-based learning techniques such as SVM, decision trees and naive Bayes seem to be only suitable for detecting malicious code, not effective enough for complex problems such as classification. In this article, we propose a new prototype extraction method for non-traditional prototype-based machine learning classification. The prototypes are extracted using hypercuboids. Each hypercuboid covers all training data points of a malware family. Then we choose the data points nearest to the hyperplanes as the prototypes. Malware samples will be classified based on the distances to the prototypes. Experiments results show that our proposition leads to F1 score of 96.5% for classification of known malware and 97.7% for classification of unknown malware, both better than the original prototype-based classification method.",50,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

We used the novel extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBR) technique together with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for feature selection to construct and verify a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 105 sampling plots conducted in November and December of 2018 and incorporated the dual polarimetric (HH and HV) data of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and the Sentinel-2 multispectral data combined with Sentinel-1 (C-band VV and VH) data. We employed the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The capability of the XGBR-GA model was assessed via a comparison with other machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e., the CatBoost regression (CBR), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) models. The XGBR-GA model yielded a promising result (R2 = 0.683, RMSE = 25.08 Mg·ha−1) and outperformed the four other ML models. The XGBR-GA model retrieved a mangrove AGB ranging from 17 Mg·ha−1 to 142 Mg·ha−1 (with an average of 72.47 Mg·ha−1). Therefore, multisource optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) combined with the XGBR-GA model can be used to estimate the mangrove AGB in North Vietnam. The effectiveness of the proposed method needs to be further tested and compared to other mangrove ecosystems in the tropics",50,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
916,1098,Intonation issues in HMM-based speech synthesis for Vietnamese.,"n an HMM-based Text-To-Speech system, contextual features, including phonetic and prosodic factors have a significant influence to the spectrum, F0 and duration of the synthetic voice. This paper proposes prosodic features aiming at improving the naturalness of an HMM-based TTS system (VTed) for a tonal language, Vietnamese. The ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) features are used to learn two crucial prosodic cues i.e. intonation (boundary tones) and pause (break indices), concurrently with another set of features. The result of MOS test showed that the general quality of synthetic voice is rather good, 1.21 point lower than the natural voice. About 55% of the voice trained with ToBI boundary tone feature are perceived as similar to the voice trained without this feature, while a 10% difference in favour of the voice trained without this ToBI feature is observed. This may be linked with F0 contour lowering or raising regardless of lexical tones. This brought two main problems in the synthetic voice: discontinuity in spectrum and F0 or unexpected voice quality. This paper then concluded the need of much more work on intonation modeling that should take into account the Vietnamese tones. A new prosody model can be designed, which may consider the ToBI model, with respect to lexical tones and the syntactic structure of Vietnamese Index Terms: Text-to-speech (TTS), speech synthesis, tonal language, Vietnamese, HMM-based speech synthesis, intonation, ToBI",50,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

The intonation of Vietnamese questions is then generated from the result of perceptual tests. Firstly, an intonation contour for the sentence is generated using our intonation model for the statement sentence. The whole contour is then raised by a number of percentages of the F0 mean called alpha (normalized register ratio).

918,1100,Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm for Simultaneous Solution of TSP and TRP.,"We study two problems called the Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TRP wants to minimize the total time for all customers that have to wait before being served, while the TSP aims to minimize the total time to visit all customers. In this sense, the TRP takes a customer-oriented view, whereas the TSP is server-oriented. In the literature, there exist numerous algorithms that are developed for two problems. However, these algorithms are designed to solve each problem independently. Recently, Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (MFEA) has been a variant of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) aiming to solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously. The MFEA framework has yet to be fully exploited, but the realm has recently attracted much interest from the research community. This paper proposed a new approach using the MFEA framework to solve these two problems simultaneously. The MFEA has two tasks simultaneously: the first is solving the TRP problem, and the second is solving the TSP. Experiment results show the efficiency of the proposed MFEA: 1. for small instances, the algorithm reaches the optimal solutions of both problems; 2. for large instances, our solutions are better than those of the previous MFEA algorithms.",54,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
919,1101,Variable neighbourhood search-based algorithm to solve the minimum back-walk-free latency problem.,"The Minimum Back-Walk-Free Latency Problem (MBLP) is an extension of the Minimum Latency Problem (MLP). It aims to find a tour with minimum latency while ignoring the back-walking costs. One of the justifications for ignoring the back-walking costs is in applications of message broadcasting for mobile devices. Obviously, the MBLP is NP-hard problem because it is a particular variant of MLP. Therefore, metaheuristic needs to be developed to provide near-optimal solutions within a short computation time. However, the main issue of metaheuristics is that they fall into local optima in some cases since the search space of the problem is combinatorial explosion. To overcome the drawback, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm combined between the Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS) and shaking technique to solve the problem. The aim of VNS is to generate diverse neighbourhoods by using various neighbourhood searches while the shaking technique guides the search towards an unexplored part of the solution space. Moreover, a technique called Adaptive Memory (AM) is applied to balance between diversity and intensification. The computational results show that the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are comparable with the state-of-the-art algorithms.

920,1102,Applying Metaheuristic for Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem in Postdisaster.,"The Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem (TDTSP) is a generalization of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Traveling Repairman Problem (TRP). In the TSP and TRP, the travel time to travel is assumed to be constant. However, in practice, the travel times vary according to several factors that naturally depend on the time of day. Therefore, the TDTSP is closer to several real practical situations than the TSP. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the TDTSP, that is, the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem in Postdisaster (TDTSP-PD). In the problem, the travel costs need to be added debris removal times after a disaster occurs. To solve the TDTSP-PD, we present an effective population-based algorithm that combines the diversification power of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the intensification strength of Local Search (LS). Therefore, our metaheuristic algorithm maintains a balance between diversification and intensification. The results of the experimental simulation are compared with the well-known and successful metaheuristic algorithms. These results show that the proposed algorithm reaches better solutions in many cases.",54,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

922,1104,An Effective Metaheuristic for Multiple Traveling Repairman Problem with Distance Constraints.,"Multiple Traveling Repairman Problem with Distance Constraints (MTRPD) is an extension of the NP-hard Multiple Traveling Repairman Problem. In MTRPD, a fleet of identical vehicles is dispatched to serve a set of customers with the following constraints. First, each vehicle's travel distance is limited by a threshold. Second, each customer must be visited exactly once. Our goal is to find the visiting order that minimizes the sum of waiting times. To solve MTRPD we propose to combine the Insertion Heuristic (IH), Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), and Tabu Search (TS) algorithms into an effective two-phase metaheuristic that includes a construction phase and an improvement phase. In the former phase, IH is used to create an initial solution. In the latter phase, we use VNS to generate various neighborhoods, while TS is employed to mainly prohibit from getting trapped into cycles. By doing so, our algorithm can support the search to escape local optima. In addition, we introduce a novel neighborhoods’ structure and a constant time operation which are efficient for calculating the cost of each neighboring solution. To show the efficiency of our proposed metaheuristic algorithm, we extensively experiment on benchmark instances. The results show that our algorithm can find the optimal solutions for all instances with up to 50 vertices in a fraction of seconds. Moreover, for instances from 60 to 80 vertices, almost all found solutions fall into the range of 0.9 %-1.1 % of the optimal solutions' lower bounds in a reasonable duration. For instances with a larger number of vertices, the algorithm reaches good-quality solutions fast. Moreover, in a comparison to the state-of-the-art metaheuristics, our proposed algorithm can find better solutions.",54,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

The manual method consumes lot of time and highly depends on the testers’ experience while the random approach faces the problem of redundant test data caused by identical use cases. By leveraging the concept of Model-based testing, this paper provides a novel method of testing to save the cost of manual testing and to increase the reliability of the testing processes. In Model-based testing, test cases and test data can be derived from different models.

926,1108,Adaptive Ranking Relevant Source Files for Bug Reports Using Genetic Algorithm.,"Precisely locating buggy files for a given bug report is a cumbersome and time-consuming task, particularly in a large-scale project with thousands of source files and bug reports. An efficient bug localization module is desirable to improve the productivity of the software maintenance phase. Many previous approaches rank source files according to their relevance to a given bug report based on simple lexical matching scores. However, the lexical mismatches between natural language expressions used to describe bug reports and technical terms of software source code might reduce the bug localization system’s accuracy. Incorporating domain knowledge through some features such as the semantic similarity, the fixing frequency of a source file, the code change history and similar bug reports is crucial to efficiently locating buggy files. In this paper, we propose a bug localization model, BugLocGA that leverages both lexical and semantic information as well as explores the relation between a bug report and a source file through some domain features. Given a bug report, we calculate the ranking score with every source files through a weighted sum of all features, where the weights are trained through a genetic algorithm with the aim of maximizing the performance of the bug localization model using two evaluation metrics: mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP). The empirical results conducted on some widely-used open source software projects have showed that our model outperformed some state of the art approaches by effectively recommending relevant files where the bug should be fixed.",56,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Among the models and the classifiers used to recognize emotions, neural networks appear to be promising due to the network’s ability to learn and the diversity in configuration. Following the convolutional neural network, a capsule neural network (CapsNet) with inputs and outputs that are not scalar quantities but vectors allows the network to determine the part-whole relationships that are specific 6 for an object. This paper performs speech emotion recognition based on CapsNet. The corpora for speech emotion recognition have been augmented by adding white noise and changing voices. The feature parameters of the recognition system input are mel spectrum images along with the characteristics of the sound source, vocal tract and prosody. For the German emotional corpus EMO-DB, the average accuracy score for 4 emotions, neutral, boredom, anger and happiness, is 99.69%. For Vietnamese emotional corpus BKEmo, this score is 94.23% for 4 emotions, neutral, sadness, anger and happiness.

Hence, with DPoS, the number of block producers is quite small compared to the total number of nodes in the blockchain network. Besides, with DPoS consensus, the distribution of block producers often centralizes into several individual nodes. This paper proposes a novel consensus protocol called Meta-heuristic Proof of Criteria (MPoC) to overcome the disadvantages. Our protocol enables multiple operational criteria to evaluate all blockchain nodes during the block producer selection process. We apply meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize the decentralized level of the node selection based on the set of criteria weights to increase the democracy of the blockchain network.We carry out experiments to evaluate the block producer decentralization of MPoC as compared with DPoS. The achieved results show that our consensus protocol improves the decentralization of block producers as expected. We also show the feasibility of applying different meta-heuristic algorithms to our consensus protocol of blockchain through experiments.",65,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
942,1126,Passivity Based Hierarchically Decentralized Range Extension Control of In-wheel-motor Vehicles.,"Range extension control of in-wheel-motor electric vehicles have been studied for years. However, there is still lack of theoretical results for rigorously stabilizing the overall control system which suffers nonlinear tire-force characteristics. In addition, it is required to locally guarantee safe motion of each driven wheel while globally increase the cruising range per charge. To deal with aforementioned issues, this paper utilizes passivity theory to present a hierarchical range extension control system. Each wheel is provided a local disturbance observer based anti-slip controller. By managing the aggregation of local wheel velocities, the global controller gives the total driving command which is optimally allocated to each wheel. The torque of each wheel is, therefore, the sum of the local control signal and the distributed signal from the global controller. Beside proving the stability rigorously, the effectiveness of the proposed control system is evaluated using Carsim-Matlab co-simulator.",65,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

However, there is still lack of practical design techniques for DOB-based applications, particularly for complex systems. To overcome this challenge, we investigate in this paper the possibility of DOB-based glocal control for a class of multi-actuator mechatronics systems possessing passivity property. In the lower-layer, each actuator is provided a DOB that locally compensates the external disturbances and model uncertainties. There exists in the upper-layer a global controller that controls an aggregation signal from the lower-layer. The aggregation and distribution channels connecting the lower/upper-layers can be treated as a middle one. Utilizing passivity theory, we rigorously obtain a condition for the global/local controllers to guarantee the stability of the overall system. We further investigate the other role of the middle-layer: attaining additional global objectives by optimization of the aggregation/distribution vectors.",65,7,based using model vietnamese data system algorithm search mobile problem optimization recognition routing networks analysis

To this end, Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a potential solution that utilizes the idle resources of vehicles to reduce the load imposed on the edge servers. In this paper, we leverage the advantages of both deep reinforcement learning and Fuzzy logic to propose Fuzzy Deep Q-learning base Offloading scheme (FDQO), a real-time offloading scheme in delay constrained VFC. Our objective is to maximize the Quality of Experiences (QoE), which indicates how the task meets its delay constraint. The experiment results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing algorithms.

The most challenge is due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties of thrust force characteristics. To overcome the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a systematic approach for altitude control using disturbance observer. In particularly, this paper shows that the overall system can be equivalently modelled as a multi-agent system with rank-1 physical interaction and sector bounded nonlinearities. Thanks to this modelling, a condition for absolute stability is derived. The condition is independent of the number of propeller actuators, and hence, considerably reducing the complexity of system design. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by both numerical simulations and experiments using a quadrotor vehicle system.",65,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

While many studies have focused on improving existing prediction techniques on accuracy aspect, less efforts is paid towards simple but efficient forecasting models in order to keep the balance between computation cost and prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel time series prediction model, which aims to both model simplicity and accuracy. The core of the model is built based on extreme learning machine. Due to the random determination process for input weights and hidden biases, extreme learning machine requires a large number of hidden neurons to achieve good results and this increases the model complexity. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new opposition-based tug of war optimization to select optimally input weights, and hidden biases then apply to extreme learning machine. Two real public traffic monitoring datasets from Internet service providers were employed to evaluate our design. The achieved outcomes demonstrate that our proposed solution works effectively with satisfied performance in comparison with existing models for distributed system workload prediction.",65,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

In general, providing power to ensure the computing power of edge servers in the MEC network is very important. In many cases, ensuring continuous power supply to the system is not possible because servers are deployed in hard-to-reach areas such as outlying areas, forests, islands, etc. This is when renewable energy prevails as a viable source of power for ensuring stable operation. This paper addresses resource provisioning in the MEC network using renewable energy.

Cyber physical systems are known to include many heterogeneous dynamical modules such as physical systems, control rules, or optimization algorithms. The connections between modules, which can be different kind of subsystems, need ""transformation of signals"" between physical quantities and information signals. In the realization of such transformation, we should care about what kind of mechanism is possible or not for its purpose. For example, the passivity based methodology to connect subsystems is convenient for guaranteeing the stability of the total systems, however the problem of the physical realization of the feedback connection emerges. From above discussion, in this paper, we focus on our previously proposed hierarchical control and optimization of power networks based on passivity methodology and discuss a problem what structures are physically realizable.",65,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning

To this end, we model the overall system by the feedback connection of a deterministic dynamical system and a stochastic memoryless map.

953,1137,BML: A Data Mapping Language for Blockchain Platforms.,"Currently, all blockchain-based applications conduct two primary operations, i.e., writing data on blockchain networks and reading these data from the networks. These tasks require users to have considerable knowledge in blockchain technology, and they become even more challenging if users want to utilize different blockchain platforms to write and read data. So far, we have not had a uniform mechanism to perform write and read operations on various blockchain platforms. In addition, writing a huge amount of data on blockchain networks is a time-consuming task and requires considerable transaction fees. To address these issues, we present in the paper a data mapping language named BML. BML allows developers to uniformly define mappings for data transformation from traditional data storage mechanisms into blockchain networks.

954,1138,A Discussion on Stabilization of Frequency Control for Power Systems.,"How to practically maintain the frequency stability of large-scale power systems by a decentralized way is a simple but non-trivial question. In other words, is it possible to design any local controller without understanding the other controlled areas and with less understanding of network structure? With respect to the special properties of physical interaction between the local areas, this paper suggests two existing theories for tackling this issue. Firstly, passivity theory is shown to be a candidate for frequency control problem using swing equation. Based on the passivity of swing dynamics, it is possible to guarantee the system stability by designing for each local area a passive controller. We further extend the passivity approach to the hierarchically decentralized control system with unknown communication delay. Secondly, we discuss the application of generalized frequency variable (GFV) to the frequency control problem using area-control-error. Each local controller is designed such that each local subsystem follows a nominal model set. Utilizing GFV theory, we present a triad of conditions that sufficiently guarantee the system stability. The conditions can be tested conveniently by a limited set of inequalities established from the GFV and the eigenvalues of the physical interaction matrix. The effectiveness, limitation, and challenge of two theories are discussed by design examples with numerical simulations.",65,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Each production process has several input buffers to stock materials for production temporarily and an output buffer to stock the produced materials temporarily. The transportation process is assumed to be realized by a swarm of vehicles, which flexibly move between buffers and transport the materials conveniently. We model the production processes as deterministic dynamical systems and the transportation processes as stochastic events. Then, we propose a distributed control method for the production rates and the transportation probabilities by employing an idea of consensus algorithms and rigorously prove that all the normalized stock levels of the buffers are globally stable at consensus values in a probabilistic sense.

956,1140,An Information-centric Approach for Slice Monitoring from Edge Devices to Clouds.,"Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled physical devices and virtual objects to be connected to share data, coordinate, and automatically make smart decisions to server people. Recently, many IoT resource slicing studies that allow managing devices, IoT platforms, network functions, and clouds under a single unified programming interface have been proposed. Although they helped IoT developers to create IoT services more easily, the efforts still have not dealt with the monitoring problem for the slice components. This could cause an issue: thing states could not be tracked continuously, and hence the effectiveness of controlling the IoT components would be decreased significantly because of updated information lack. In this paper, we introduce an information-centric approach for multiple sources monitoring issue in IoT. The proposed model thus is designed to provide generic and extensible data format for diverse IoT objects. Through this model, IoT developers can build smart services smoothly without worrying about the diversity as well as heterogeneity of collected data. We also propose an overall monitoring architecture for the information-centric model to deploy in IoT environment and its monitoring API prototype.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a framework for glocal (global/local) control of load frequency. The command to each local governor includes two signals: the local signal through the corresponding area-control error (ACE) in the lower-layer, and the global signal distributed from the upper-layer by controlling the average frequency aggregation. We will clarify the role-sharing of the upper and lower layers via two model sets which are shared in both control layers.

960,1144,Hierarchically decentralized control for in-wheel-motored electric vehicles with global and local objectives.,"Motion control of electric vehicle has been widely studies for many years. Usually, the control system is designed hierarchically, including the upper-layer that performs car motion global objectives, and the lower-layer that controls the local actuators. However, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic theory to analyze and design the vehicle system as a whole. Almost the published works treat the upper-layer and lower-layer separately and neglect the actuators' physical interaction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchically decentralized control for electric vehicle driven by multi in-wheel-motors. Our main idea is to clarify the role-sharing of the upper and lower layers via a shared model set which should be considered in both layers. We clearly represent the trade-off between the global and local objectives through the size of the model set.

However, no effort has been paid to the stability analysis of tire force distribution theoretically. Let the actuators (in-wheel-motors and steering motors) be the local agents, the electric vehicle can be seen as a special type of multi-agent system. The agents are not decoupled but they physically interact with each other via the vehicle body. As the increasing of the actuator number, stability analysis becomes more and more complex. By modeling the EV system with generalized frequency variable, we propose a systematic scheme that can considerably reduce the burden of stability analysis for tire force distribution.",65,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

965,1151,Multirate Estimation and Control of Body Slip Angle for Electric Vehicles Based on Onboard Vision System.,"A new method for vehicle body-slip-angle estimation using nontraditional sensor configuration and system model is proposed, which enables robust estimation against vehicle parameter uncertainties. In this approach, a linear vehicle bicycle model is augmented with a simple visual model. As the visual model contains few uncertain parameters and increases the observer's design freedom, the combined model-based estimator provides more accurate estimation result compared with the traditional bicycle-model-based one. However, two issues are raised by the combined vehicle and vision models: 1) image processing introduces delay in the visual measurements, and 2) the sampling time of a normal camera is much longer than that of other onboard sensors. For electric vehicles, the control period of motors is much shorter than the sampling time of a normal camera. Considering the aforementioned delay and multirate problems, a multirate Kalman filter with intersample compensation is designed, and the estimation performance can be improved during the sampling intervals of the vision system. Then, a two-degree-of-freedom controller is designed using the estimated body slip angle as feedback for reference tracking. With the proposed multirate estimator, the controller achieves better tracking performance than the singlerate method. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator and controller is demonstrated by both simulations and experiments.",65,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

Although the number and quality of cloud services are daily rising, but on the other aspect, the user requirements for the services also increase very fast and diversely. One of the prominent user demands is the need of a solution that can help them automatically choose suitable resources to deploy appliances into cloud environment.

Although a visual servo is expected to achieve robust positioning control by eliminating positional errors due to operation environments, applying visual information to positioning control faces three challenges, namely, lower sampling speed, longer delay, and lower positional accuracy than those possible by using a conventional position encoder. To overcome these problems, a multi-rate Kalman filter with a time-delay compensation technique is employed to combine visual information with encoder-based positional information. Two models describing a positioning-control experimental system using a one-axis linear stage with a camera were investigated to determine the optimum structure of the Kalman filter.

In fact, vision-based lane keeping and automatic steering have been intensively studied in the past few decades. Meanwhile, electric vehicles, as green solutions for future transportation, are gaining increasing attentions nowadays. From the viewpoint of motion control, differential torque between left and right in-wheel-motors is considered as an effective method for lateral safety control of electric vehicles. Nevertheless, the sampling rate of normal cameras is 30 Hz, which is much slower compared with that of motors and other kinds of onboard sensors. Moreover, image processing brings uneven time delay (which is usually measurable) into the visual signals, which further complicate the system sampling sequence. Many previous research simply adapt the whole system's sampling frequency to the camera; however, the held and random delayed feedbacks deteriorate system performance and may cause instability. In this paper, the two problems are solved by a multi-rate Kalman filter with random measurement delays compensation using a residual estimation technique.",65,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

978,1168,Modeling and debugging numerical constraints of cyber-physical systems design.,"To design and analyze Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), engineers should consider computation and physical processes at the same time. Engineers require a design description which is easy to understand. SysML provides diagrammatic notations which are independent of specific disciplines. To express numerical constraints of SysML diagrams, we extend OCL with real arithmetic. Both SysML and extended-OCL require an executable design language to check inconsistencies of constraints. To achieve the above idea, we bridge a gap between SysML and VDM-RT. We propose a framework to embed SysML/extended-OCL into VDM-RT, where we prepare some libraries for extended-OCL. It is unnecessary for engineers to know VDM-RT. Using a unified CPS design description, our approach automatically debugs inconsistencies in whole CPS design. This paper illustrates the proposed method with a car race system.",68,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Since the data are not ready to be linked to other sources, some governments have started to follow the Linked Open Data paradigm as a mean to improve data quality. However, exploiting Linked Data is still a challenging task, which requires a profound understanding of underlying datasets, as well as considerable technical expertise.

980,1170,Open Linked Widgets Mashup Platform.,"Since the emergence of the mashup concept on the web around 2005, a large stream of academic research and industrial development resulted in numerous architecture proposals, platforms and editing tools. This strong initial interest in mashup technologies and promising use case demonstrations notwithstanding, however, commercial platforms such as Microsoft Popfly, IBM Mashup Center, and Google Mashup Editor failed to gain widespread adoption by consumers and enterprises and were eventually discontinued. This failure may be attributed to a number of common limitations of these platforms:(i) they are each useful only for a single or a limited number of restricted problems in specific domains;(ii) they are closed, ie, developers cannot contribute and share their widgets;(iii) widgets, which are crucial elements of any mashup platform, are usually not modeled in sufficient semantic detail to support widget search and composition features that facilitate reuse. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing an open mashup platform based on semantic web technologies. We present a novel architecture in which widgets equipped with a semantic, graph-based model can cooperate with each other in a mashup created by end users through simple drag and drop operations. Widgets created freely by independent developers and hosted on arbitrary servers can be discovered and combined easily through our introduced semantic search feature.",73,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

Pervasively available sensors and the data they generate can help to address pressing environmental challenges in urban areas by making crucial information available to researchers and decision-makers. However, environmental data is at present typically stored in disparate systems and formats, which inhibits reuse and recombination. Furthermore, the large amounts of environmental data that stream in continuously require novel processing approaches. So far, however, research at the intersection of environmental sciences and urban data to overcome these barriers has been scarce. To address these issues, we develop a novel framework using semantic web technologies. We apply ontological concepts and semantic stream processing technologies in order to facilitate combination, comparison, and visualization of heterogeneous data from various sources. The platform for environmental data stream analysis introduced in this paper can inform and support decision-making by non-expert users.

Available systems typically use public blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin to store learning results. However, the cost of writing data on these networks is significant, making educational institutions limit data sent to the target network, typically containing only hash codes of the issued certificates. In this paper, we present a system based on a private blockchain network for lifelong learning data authentication and management named B4E (Blockchain For Education). B4E stores not only certificates but also learners’ training data such as transcripts and educational programs in order to create a complete record of the lifelong education of each user and verify certificates that they have obtained. As a result, B4E can address two types of fake certificates, i.e., certificates printed by unlawful organizations and certificates issued by educational institutions for learners who have not met the training requirements. In addition, B4E is designed to allow all participants to easily deploy software packages to manage, share, and check stored information without depending on a single point of access. As such, the system enhances the transparency and reliability of the stored data. Our experiments show that B4E meets expectations for deployment in reality.",70,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

In this paper, we present a decentralized storage and sharing system based on a combination of IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System), encryption technologies (including Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC), ABE (Attribute-based Encryption), Multi-Authority ABE (MA-ABE)), and multichain. In particular, we facilitate the advantages of the IPFS network to store user's data in a distributed manner. Furthermore, we make use of a cryptographer to protect the privacy of data. The hash returned by the IPFS network will be stored in our multichain architecture to provide transparency for all users participating in the system. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first storage and sharing system using IPFS, cryptographer, and multichain to ensure decentralized, trustworthy, transparent characteristics for storing and sharing data.",70,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
985,1175,MPoC - A Metaheuristic Proof of Criteria Consensus Protocol for Blockchain Network.,"Over the last years, many blockchain platforms opt for Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol for their network deployment. However, using the DPoS, nodes on the network tend to vote for the nodes that are more likely to become block producers after several voting rounds. Hence, with DPoS, the number of block producers is quite small compared to the total number of nodes in the blockchain network. Besides, with DPoS consensus, the distribution of block producers often centralizes into several individual nodes. This paper proposes a novel consensus protocol called Meta-heuristic Proof of Criteria (MPoC) to overcome the disadvantages. Our protocol enables multiple operational criteria to evaluate all blockchain nodes during the block producer selection process. We apply meta-heuristic algorithms to optimize the decentralized level of the node selection based on the set of criteria weights to increase the democracy of the blockchain network.We carry out experiments to evaluate the block producer decentralization of MPoC as compared with DPoS. The achieved results show that our consensus protocol improves the decentralization of block producers as expected. We also show the feasibility of applying different meta-heuristic algorithms to our consensus protocol of blockchain through experiments.",70,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

Although initial steps towards web of Vietnam's labour market have been established, a united system which can collect, integrate, and analyze job advertisements from different sources has not existed yet. To address this problem, we introduce a system named VNJobSpace. VNJobSpace is composed by six main components which are responsible for collecting, integrating and analyzing job advertisements. In addition, it contains three databases to store job data, schema of each source, and collected curricula. At present, VNJobSpace provides access to more than 700,000 advertisements from 14 job portals in Vietnam.

So far, we have not had a uniform mechanism to perform write and read operations on various blockchain platforms. In addition, writing a huge amount of data on blockchain networks is a time-consuming task and requires considerable transaction fees. To address these issues, we present in the paper a data mapping language named BML. BML allows developers to uniformly define mappings for data transformation from traditional data storage mechanisms into blockchain networks. Conversely, this language also assists users in reading transformed data. Currently, BML accepts five input data sources, including XML, JSON, XLSX, SQL (relational database), NoSQL, and supports two output platforms, including Hyperledger Sawtooth and Ethereum.",70,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
989,1179,Towards Open Data Mashups for Data Journalism.,"In line with a broad social and political movement in recent years, public and private sector actors have started to open up their data and to publish it on various portals. However, the actual use of the available open data sets is still rather limited in many sectors. Consequently, the potentials of available open data sets are not fully realized, which may discourage open data publishers. To encourage a broader adoption of open data and to contribute towards making democratic processes more transparent, critical data journalism is essential. In this demo paper, we propose an approach called Open Data Mashups for Data Journalism (ODMOJO) that aims to bridge open data publishers and their consumers, i.e., journalists and society at large, with Linked Data technologies. Specifically, our approach will facilitate the access, reuse, and integration of open data for General Data Journalism.

990,1180,Linked Widgets Platform for Rapid Collaborative Semantic Mashup Development.,"In recent years, data has become vital in supporting our everyday lives. Along with large volumes of open data available on the web, various types of public, private, and enterprise data are stored in the cloud or distributed over multiple devices. The value of this data would increase drastically if we were able to integrate it. This would enable more sophisticated presentation and analysis of previously disparate data. So far, however, it is challenging for non-expert users to efficiently make use of such data because (i) data heterogeneity hampers integration of different kinds of data that are stored in various formats and spread among storage infrastructures; (ii) manual data integration processes are typically neither reproducible, nor reusable; and (iii) the lack of support for exploration does not allow for the integration of arbitrary data sources. This paper tackles these challenges by introducing a mashup platform that combines semantic web and mashup concepts to help users obtain insights and make informed decisions. To this end, we leverage a semantic model of mashup components for automated techniques that support the user in exploring available data. Moreover, we introduce a collaborative and distributed model to create and execute mashups.

However, although this concept has opened up many opportunities for data sharing and collaboration, integrating data is still a challenging task that requires considerable technical expertise and a profound understanding of the underlying datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to provide knowledge workers with the necessary tools to leverage the fast growing Linked Data Cloud by creating semantic-aware dataflow processes. To this end, we introduce the “Linked Widget” concept as an enhancement of standard Web Widgets. These widgets are based on a semantic data model that facilitates powerful mechanisms for gathering, processing, integration, and visualization of data in a user-friendly Mashup environment. By allowing knowledge workers to easily create complex Linked Data applications in an adhoc manner, our approach should contribute towards reducing existing barriers of Linked Data adoption.",70,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Many national and international organizations today leverage semantic web technologies to make statistical datasets available as Linked Open Data (LOD). A key advantages of this approach is that the data not only becomes publicly available, but also machine-readable and hence suitable for automated discovery and exploration. Whereas this has great potential to support interesting use cases, it remains difficult for end users today to utilize and combine these statistical Linked Data. Three challenges are: (i) directing users to relevant data sources based on a specified location; (ii) facilitating data integration despite a lack of outgoing links between datasets; and (iii) offering flexible means to integrate and aggregate data from various sources. As time and location are highly relevant dimensions in most statistical data, we address the identified challenges by first constructing geographical metadata for statistical sources.

However, the previous methods have remained several problems. While autoregressive models suffer from slow inference speed, non-autoregressive models usually have a complicated, time and memory-consuming training pipeline. This paper proposes a novel model called FastTacotron, which is an improved text-to-speech method based on ForwardTacotron. The proposed model uses the recurrent Tacotron architecture but replacing its autoregressive attentive part with a single forward pass to accelerate the inference speed. The model also replaces the attention mechanism in Tacotron with a length regulator like the one in FastSpeech for parallel mel-spectrogram generation. Moreover, we introduce more prosodic information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy, and more accurate duration) as conditional inputs to make the duration predictor more accurate.

The state-of-the-art printed text recognition methods are often based on attention mechanisms. However, these methods perform poorly on images captured due to poor illumination conditions, blur, noise, and low resolution. To address these unfavorable conditions, we propose a new text recognition method based on an encoder-decoder model. Particularly, we present a novel attention mechanism using a multi-scale cascade fashion combined with a channel attention gate module. Our model is also strengthened by an EfficientNet-like backbone. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets, including SROIE 2019, B-MOD, and CORD, show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline attention mechanism and achieves competitive accuracy compared to other state-ofthe-art approaches.",72,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
1014,1205,Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation with Dilated Multi-fiber Network and Weighted Bi-directional Feature Pyramid Network.,"Brain tumor segmentation is critical for precise diagnosis and personalised treatment of brain cancer. Due to the recent success of deep learning, many deep learning based segmentation methods have been developed. However, most of them are computationally expensive due to complicated network architectures. Recently, multi-fiber networks were proposed to reduce the number of network parameters in U-Net based brain tumor segmentation through efficient graph convolution. However, the efficient use of multi-scale features has not been well explored between contracting and expanding paths except simple concatenation. In this paper, we propose a light-weight network where contracting and expanding paths are connected with fused multi-scale features through bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN). The backbone of our proposed network has a dilated multi-fiber (DMF) structure based U-net architecture. First, conventional convolutional layers along the contracting and expanding paths are replaced with a DMF network and an MF network, respectively, to reduce the overall network size. In addition, a learnable weighted DMF network is utilized to take into account different receptive sizes effectively. Next, a weighted BiFPN is utilized to connect contracting and expanding paths, which enables more effective and efficient information flow between the two paths with multi-scale features. Note that the BiFPN block can be repeated as necessary. As a result, our proposed network is able to further reduce the network size without clearly compromising segmentation accuracy. Experimental results on the popular BraTS 2018 dataset demonstrate that our proposed light-weight architecture is able to achieve at least comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly reduced network complexity and computation time. The source code of this paper will be available at Github.",72,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
1015,1206,A Novel Generative Model to Synthesize Face Images for Pose-invariant Face Recognition.,"Face recognition is an active research area in computer vision, which has been widely used in various applications such as security, video surveillance and personal identification. Although recent studies in this field have achieved great successes, they usually require an enormous amount of data for training and yet still have difficulties in in-the-wild dataset due to large variation of pose, illumination, expression. Among these unconstrained conditions, pose variation is thought to be the factor that harms face recognition accuracy the most. In order to deal with pose variation, one can fulfill the incomplete UV map extracted from in-the-wild faces, then attach the completed UV map to a fitted 3D mesh and finally generate different 2D faces of arbitrary poses, which then can be used for training or testing face recognition models. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called ResCUNet-GAN to improve UV map completion. Particularly, we improve the original UV-GAN by stacking two U-Nets and enhancing it with multiple-level residual connections and feature fusion. The experiments on the popular Multi-PIE dataset shows that our model outperforms the original UV-GAN model.",72,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

By approximating the pose, the approximation of expression parameters is reduced to a linear regression problem of which the closed-form solution is readily available, resulting in the improvement in inference speed.

This strategy has overlooked the spatial-temporal features interaction. In this paper, we propose new two-stream CNN architectures that are able to learn the relation between two kinds of features.

Recently, an emerging trend in using l2-norm has shown its advantages in both accuracy and computational speed. However, the supervised approach that exploits label information in the training phase has not been investigated in such l2-norm based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised dictionary learning method that incorporates label information in the objective function.

STFs allow fast computing of texton codebooks for powerful low-level image feature description. MRFs, with the most effective algorithm in message passing for training, will smooth out the segmentation results of STFs using pairwise coherent information between neighboring pixels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known benchmark datasets including the 21-class MSRC dataset and the VOC 2007 dataset.

Standards such as the W3C RDF data cube vocabulary and the content-oriented guidelines of SDMX provide a foundation to tackle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework that semi-automatically performs semantic data integration on statistical raw data sources at query time. We follow existing standards to transform non-semantic data structures to RDF format. Furthermore, we describe each data set with semantic metadata to deal with inconsistent use of terminologies.

One possible explanation is the gap between the large amounts of published LOD datasets and the lack of end-user tools to effectively explore them. Because existing applications are tailored towards specific datasets and do not allow for reuse and extension, novice users have so far had limited means to access the rich data sources being published. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach to support non-expert users in the flexible exploration of LOD. To this end, we define a formal model that makes use of existing links between interconnected datasets.

We then propose a novel framework that enables to incorporate the prior knowledge of different forms into a base Bayesian model for data streams. Our framework subsumes some existing popular models for time-series/dynamic data. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms existing methods with a large margin. In particular, our framework can help Bayesian models generalize well on extremely short text while other methods overfit.

They are not only a good marketing resource but also a power business tool. To make websites reliable and always available for customers, a large number of website monitoring services have been developed to periodically check the website uptime and performance. These services typically have a very limited number of checkpoints (i.e., geographical locations where we send monitoring requests to check the websites) and internet service providers (ISP) used by these checkpoints; it is because deploying checkpoints with low usage frequency would waste them a huge amount of money. Thus they cannot detect that a website is reachable from a city and an ISP but is unreachable from the others. To address this issue, this paper presents a crowdsourcing-based approach that makes use of browser extensions as checkpoints to monitor websites. Our main contributions include: (i) a website monitoring approach that combines the concepts of crowdsourcing and browser extensions; (ii) a batch processing technique for handling monitoring requests; (iii) the architecture of a conceptual crowdsourcing-based system for website monitoring that can coordinate a large number of crowd members; and (iv) various techniques to enhance the quality of monitoring.",73,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning

Three challenges are: (i) directing users to relevant data sources based on a specified location; (ii) facilitating data integration despite a lack of outgoing links between datasets; and (iii) offering flexible means to integrate and aggregate data from various sources. As time and location are highly relevant dimensions in most statistical data, we address the identified challenges by first constructing geographical metadata for statistical sources.

We propose the Neural Poisson factorization (NPF) model which is a hybrid of deep learning and Poisson factorization. While Poisson factorization is suitable to model discrete, massive and sparse feedback, using a deep neural network and pre-trained word embeddings can learn hidden semantic in short item descriptions well. Therefore, NPF overcomes the limitation of existing models when dealing with short texts and a sparse feedback matrix. Moreover, we develop a random view algorithm based on stochastic learning for our model, in which each user is only viewed a random subset of items and his/her feedback on the subset is used to update his/her representation in each iteration.

However, it has to face the famous stability-plasticity dilemma and the problem of noisy and sparse data. We propose a novel and easy-to-implement framework, called Infinite Dropout (iDropout), to address these challenges. iDropout has an easy mechanism to balance between old and new information, which allows models to trade off stability against plasticity. Thanks to the ability to reduce overfitting and the ensemble property of Dropout, our framework obtains better generalization, thus effectively handles undesirable effects of noise and sparsity. Further, iDropout is able to adapt quickly to abnormal changes in data streams. We theoretically analyze the equivalence of Dropout in iDropout to a regularizer, well applied to a much larger context than what was known before.

1127,1336,From implicit to explicit feedback: A deep neural network for modeling the sequential behavior of online users,"We demonstrate the advantages of taking into account multiple types of behavior in recommendation systems. Intuitively, each user has to do some\textbf {implicit} actions (eg, click) before making an\textbf {explicit} decision (eg, purchase). Previous works showed that implicit and explicit feedback has distinct properties to make a useful recommendation. However, these works exploit implicit and explicit behavior separately and therefore ignore the semantic of interaction between users and items. In this paper, we propose a novel model namely\textit {Implicit to Explicit (ITE)} which directly models the order of user actions. Furthermore, we present an extended version of ITE, namely\textit {Implicit to Explicit with Side information (ITE-Si)}, which incorporates side information to enrich the representations of users and items. The experimental results show that both ITE and ITE-Si outperform existing recommendation systems and also demonstrate the effectiveness of side information in two large scale datasets.",77,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

In this work, we explore this property in a multi-task learning framework for IDRR in which the relations and the connectives are simultaneously predicted, and the mapping is leveraged to transfer knowledge between the two prediction tasks via the embeddings of relations and connectives. We propose several techniques to enable such knowledge transfer that yield the state-of-the-art performance for IDRR on several settings of the benchmark dataset (ie, the Penn Discourse Treebank dataset).",77,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

If We can find multiple paths that satisfies bandwidth requirement, split the original message into multiple smaller messages to transmit concurrently on these paths. On destination nodes, combine separated messages into the original message. Hence it can utilize better network resources, causes data transfer rate to be higher, load balancing, failover. Service Oriented Routing is inherited from the model of content based routing (CBR), combined with several advanced techniques such as Multicast, multiple path routing, Genetic algorithm to increase the data rate, and data encryption to ensure information security. Fuzzy logic is a logical field study evaluating the accuracy of the results based on the approximation of the components involved, make decisions based on many factors relative accuracy based on experimental or mathematical proof.

When a content request happens, the subscriber will create a subscription message. The subscription message stores several kinds of information, the most important content is a filter that is a conjunction of some constraints [5]. A filter is denoted by F character, that has mathematical formula: F= C, in which C is service request, has the format: C=‘Service_name= requested service name’. Every C (i= 2.. n) is a constraint that is formed by three components:(Key, op, Value), Key is a keyword for searching, op is an operator, Value is searching condition. Key belongs to the set of name of properties of content messages that the requested service supplies. Op is an operator that depends on the type of data of the Key. Therefore the forwarding table is a set of filters which are received from all subscribers on networks. The algorithms for inserting, updating, deleting and finding filters that match content messages have been published by service providers are very important.

Using prior knowledge to enrich a topic model is one of potential solutions to cope with these challenges. Prior knowledge that is derived from human knowledge (e.g. Wordnet) or a pre-trained model (e.g. Word2vec) is very valuable and useful to help topic models work better. However, in a streaming environment where data arrives continually and infinitely, existing studies are limited to exploiting these resources effectively. Especially, a knowledge graph, that contains meaningful word relations, is ignored. In this paper, to aim at exploiting a knowledge graph effectively, we propose a novel graph convolutional topic model (GCTM) which integrates graph convolutional networks (GCN) into a topic model and a learning method which learns the networks and the topic model simultaneously for data streams. In each minibatch, our method not only can exploit an external knowledge graph but also can balance the external and old knowledge to perform well on new data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our method with both a human knowledge graph (Wordnet) and a graph built from pre-trained word embeddings (Word2vec).

In supervised dimension reduction, class labels are integrated into the lower-dimensional representation, to produce better results on classification tasks. The supervised dimension reduction (SDR) framework by [17] is one of the state-of-the-art methods that takes into account not only the class labels but also the neighborhood graphs of the data, and have some advantages in preserving the within-class local structure and widening the between-class margin. However, the reduced-dimensional representation produced by the SDR framework suffers from the class overlapping problem - in which, data points lie closer to a different class rather than the class they belong to. The class overlapping problem can hurt the quality on the classification task. In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce the overlap for the SDR framework in [17]. The experimental results show that our method reduces the size of the overlapping set by an order of magnitude. As a result, our method outperforms the pre-existing framework on the classification task significantly. Moreover, visualization plots show that the reduced-dimensional representation learned by our method is more scattered for within-class data and more separated for between-class data, as compared to the pre-existing SDR framework.",77,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

In addition, B4E is designed to allow all participants to easily deploy software packages to manage, share, and check stored information without depending on a single point of access.

The routing task can be operated on a wider scale. It can process based on results of some other protocols for example service based protocol can be operated based on the service discovery protocol. So this kind of routing protocols may be determinized as upper layer routing protocols. Such as the service based routing protocol can operate based on content based protocol and combines some service filters. In service based routing protocol as well as content based routing protocol, subscriber and publisher can communicate with each other but they don’t know the other’s address. So it is more flexible in processing and more comfortable for mobile ad-hoc network. In mobile ad-hoc networks, nodes usually move, so bandwidth of connection between them may be not stable. Therefore transmission delay, overhead and packet loss may be larger than other kinds of networks. The paper aims at purpose to increase QoS of routing by hierarchical clustering routing by using \( R^{ + } \) tree in addition with some advanced techniques such as multicast routing, multiple paths, use can ACO to optimize routes to transmit data. By using R tree structure, the network topology are managed by bottom-up model from leaf level to root of the tree. All the leaf nodes, inner nodes and root of this tree have two roles: (i) Manage a cluster that consisting all nodes that have direct connections with this node; (ii) Operate as a normal node. The paper introduces and analyzes: (i) Establish hierarchical clustering network by using R tree structure; (ii) Make multicast tree from some cluster heads for fast routing; (iii) Make optimized route by Ant Colony Optimization.

It defines the routing based on the messages it cares. It determines the appropriate message class based on message content based on its key-value pairs or regular expressions. Therefore, in SBR routing the receiver determines the transmission of messages, not the sender. Communication based on content services increases the independence, flexibility in the distributed architecture.

This paper proposes a correlation-based approach that evaluates the correlation between two data sets using a simple calculation and that guarantees the accuracy in correlated evaluation between data. This correlation-based method is proposed to cluster sensor nodes into HCRs.

In this paper, we propose a new Android application for fall detection based on theory of machine learning and data mining. Concretely, we used a classification method to detect if it is a fall down or another common events (e.g. sitting, jumping, etc.). The obtained experimental results show that our proposal yielded impressive results compared to related works",81,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
1195,1416,A generalized resource allocation framework in support of multi-layer virtual network embedding based on SDN.,"Network Virtualization (NV) allows multiple heterogeneous architectures to simultaneously coexist in a shared infrastructure. Embedding multiple virtual networks (VNs) in a shared substrate deals with efficient mapping of virtual resources in the physical infrastructure and is referred to as the Virtual Network Embedding problem (VNE-problem). Although there is recently a number of research work in the area of network virtualization based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, virtual network embedding in SDN remains challenging from both theoretical and practical points of view. This article focuses on virtual network embedding strategies and related issues for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) paradigms under the constraint of fixed virtual node locations. Special considerations are given to the problems related to resource allocation and link sharing of multi-layer virtual networks on top of the physical substrate. Firstly, a heuristic virtual network embedding algorithm is proposed that can improve the mapping acceptance ratio and resource efficiency in the IaaS context. Secondly, REsource reSERvation in generalized Virtual NETworks (ReServNet), a Software-Defined Networking platform designed for embedding multi-level virtual networks in physical infrastructures is developed. By defining new softwarized logical functions, ReServNet allows network administrators to create and manage multiple virtual networks on top of the physical network and allocate bandwidth resources to them accordingly. Moreover, the ReServNet framework allows for designing, prototyping, benchmarking and evaluating the performance of different network embedding algorithms easily in real SDN virtualization environments. Different issues related to virtual network embedding on SDN-based physical substrate are also analyzed and discussed in detail.",81,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
1196,1417,An application for diagnosing lung diseases on Android phone.,"Nowadays, lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis, are increasingly attracting the attention of the world medical community. The main reason is due to the increasing environmental pollution problem. Therefore, detecting pulmonary exacerbations and improving outcomes of chronic lung ailments are in urgent need. Traditionally, patients have to go to pulmonary hospital and use conventional spirometers. However, the challenge of this solution is the cost and the loss of time. Patients may take several hours to queue to see a doctor and have to pay for medical expenses. In order to solve this inconvenience, we proposed an approach, called BKSpiro, for measuring lung function using Android phone, a very popular device for everyone today. BKSpiro has the potential for more rapid recovery, earlier treatment of exacerbations, and reduce health care costs.",81,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
1197,1418,A Lateration-localizing Algorithm for Energy-efficient Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks.,"Target tracking systems, such as battlefield surveillance, wildlife monitoring and border security, need to meet certain real-time constraints in response to transient events, such as fast-moving targets. In addition, a tracking system also needs to address other important properties, such as energy consumption (due to limited power and the processing capability of sensor nodes) and tracking accuracy. In this work, we first propose a Lateration-localizing algorithm to estimate the trajectory of a dynamic target. Based on this Lateration scheme, we propose an energy efficient tracking method that achieves high tracking accuracy and low end-to-end delay.

1198,1419,A low-latency communication protocol for target tracking in wireless sensor networks.,"Target tracking applications in wireless sensor networks need to achieve energy efficiency, tracking accuracy, and certain real-time constraints in response to fast-moving targets. From a layer view, an energy-efficient cross-layer communication protocol that consists of a medium access control layer and network routing layer is necessary for joint optimization. Due to the interference and contention over the wireless medium, the limited resources of battery-operated sensor nodes, and the dynamic topology of large-scale networks, this cross-layer design becomes a challenging task. In this research, we exploit a cluster routing algorithm over large-scale networks and propose a low-duty-cycle medium access control (MAC) algorithm to reduce collision, idle-listening, and overhearing. In addition, our work focuses on the joint optimization of routing and a MAC strategy for achieving a good trade-off between low delay, energy efficiency, and tracking accuracy. To deploy this protocol in a real tracking application, we also propose a clustering synchronization procedure that does not require distributing the global timing information over the complete network to achieve network-wide time synchronization. An analytical model and extensive simulations are proposed to evaluate and compare the performance of our work with existing protocols. Simulation and analysis results show that our approach achieves better communication delay and thus better tracking error while maintaining reasonable energy consumption compared to other cases.",81,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

In such broadband wireless systems, one major issue is how to utilize radio resource efficiently while maintaining fairness between sessions as well as providing adequate QoS. In this work, we propose an approach for OFDMA/time division duplex (TDD) downlink suitable for IEEE802.16e WiMAX systems that combines scheduling and burst mapping algorithms for a trade-off between session fairness, QoS, and spectral efficiency. While optimizing radio resources under QoS and fairness constraints is an NP-hard problem, we follow a heuristic approach that simplifies the complexity of the algorithm. Performance results show that while the new scheme outperforms the Proportional Fair algorithm in terms of fairness, it also improves the overall system spectral efficiency.

1200,1421,Modeling and experimenting combined smart sleep and power scaling algorithms in energy-aware data center networks.,"Recent surveys have shown that the energy consumption in a data center considerably contributes to its operation costs. A remarkable part of the large energy volume consumed in data centers today is due to the over-provisioning of such network resources as switches, links, and servers to meet the stringent requirements on reliability. Therefore performance and energy issues are important factors for the design of large multi-tier data centers that can support multiple services. However, the design, analysis, and experiments of such a large and complex system often suffer from the lack of appropriate experimental infrastructures. In this paper, we firstly propose a new energy saving scheme that combines smart sleeping and power scaling algorithms. An energy analysis model is then proposed to calculate the energy saving bounds in case of low and high traffic utilization. We also present a platform for in-depth analysis of energy-aware data center networks, which is a combination of hardware testbed and emulation. Based on OpenFlow technology, the experimental platform is designed to capture details of energy consumed by all network components such as links, ports, and switches under different scenarios.

We present in this paper a new cluster-based and event-driven routing algorithm (called Reliable and Energy-efficient Cluster-based and Event-driven Routing algorithm-RECER).

1202,1423,Improvement of energy consumption and load balance for LEACH in Wireless Sensors Networks.,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a promising approach for a variety of applications. Because of limitation of energy resource, memory space and processing capability of sensor nodes, it is very difficult to implement IP-based routing protocols in WSN. Recently, many research focus on developing special routing protocols for WSNs with the main design criteria: energy efficiency, load balance and reliability. The most well known routing protocol class is hierarchical which divides network into many clusters. Each cluster is represented by a cluster head (CH) that is responsible for receiving data from all non-CH members, aggregating these data and sending to the base station (BS). In order to balance energy consumption of the entire network, CHs are not fixed but rotated. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols can decrease and balance the energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. LEACH is one of the first cluster-based for WSN, which includes distributed cluster formation. In this paper, we propose a new hierarchical routing protocol (called EL-LEACH: Energy and Load balance LEACH) which achieves energy efficiency and load balance. Our simulation result shows that our new scheme EL-LEACH achieves better energy consumption, load balance and network life time than other well known LEACH protocols.",81,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
1203,1424,Multipath routing for cluster-based and event-based protocols in wireless sensor networks.,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that consists of a large number of small sensing self-powered nodes is a promising approach for a variety of applications. Possible applications of WSN are of interest to the most diverse fields: environmental monitoring, warfare, child education, surveillance, micro-surgery and agriculture are only few examples. Due to limited power of sensor nodes that are distributed in a large geographical area, the WSN requires robust but simple, scalable, energy-efficient and also self-configurable routing algorithms. From these characteristics, WSN routing protocol can coarsely be classified in two main classes: flat and hierarchical approaches. Hierarchical solution (also called cluster-based) separates nodes in clusters and the communication within clusters is possible only through the selected leaders or Cluster Head-CH. In the reality, it is not always necessary to divide all the network to clusters because one event can only appear in a small part. In this case, routing protocol needs to form only one cluster with one CH for minimizing the amount of data sending to the base station (BS). Some such routing approaches (called cluster-based and event-based) are proposed as ARPEES [1], OEDSR [2], HPEQ[3]... but they all create only one optimal route from CH to the BS and this route can be broken when the sensor node's power is negligible. In this paper, we propose two multipath solutions called Multiparth ARPEES (MARPEES) and Energy Aware Mesh Routing Protocol (EMRP) for ensuring reliable and fault-tolerance data transmission while balancing node's energy consumption in the network and minimizing the control overhead. The simulation results show that our solutions achieve better performance than other cluster-based and event-based routing protocols.",81,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
1204,1425,Multimedia session continuity with context-aware capability in IMS-based network.,"In this paper we firstly proved that mobile IP protocols are designed for mobility but not for session continuity. In contradiction, mSCTP (mobile stream control transmission protocol) appears to be the best protocol with regard to session continuity support, however it does not support location management mechanisms, thus context-aware QoS as well as other mechanisms based on knowledge of location are hardly accommodated. On the other hand, the standardized IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) solution initially introduced by 3GPP adopts the policy-based QoS model to map user's subscription to a pre-defined QoS level, to apply service-based charging and to prevent theft-of-service. In this article we propose a new approach that integrates mSCTP into IMS networks to facilitate session continuity and to provide mechanisms for service control. It is realized by a proxy based on mSCTP (mobile stream control transmission protocol) that acts as an anchor point for soft vertical handover of mobile nodes, which have multiple physical interfaces (e.g., WLAN/UMTS). The mSCTP-based proxy also supports QoS provisioning and adaptation for the mobile nodes when moving in a heterogeneous wireless environment. Results show that the signaling cost for handover in our approach can be up to 23 times smaller than that in the conventional approach.",81,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

To address this problem, we propose an efficient label propagation learning algorithm based on the graph-based regularization framework with adjusting network structure iteratively to improve the accuracy of classification algorithm for noisy data. We show empirically that this adjusting network structure improves significantly the performance of the algorithm for web page classification.

Along with large volumes of open data available on the web, various types of public, private, and enterprise data are stored in the cloud or distributed over multiple devices. The value of this data would increase drastically if we were able to integrate it. This would enable more sophisticated presentation and analysis of previously disparate data. So far, however, it is challenging for non-expert users to efficiently make use of such data because (i) data heterogeneity hampers integration of different kinds of data that are stored in various formats and spread among storage infrastructures; (ii) manual data integration processes are typically neither reproducible, nor reusable; and (iii) the lack of support for exploration does not allow for the integration of arbitrary data sources. This paper tackles these challenges by introducing a mashup platform that combines semantic web and mashup concepts to help users obtain insights and make informed decisions. To this end, we leverage a semantic model of mashup components for automated techniques that support the user in exploring available data. Moreover, we introduce a collaborative and distributed model to create and execute mashups.

Currently, methods of treating diabetes are inadequate and costly so prevention becomes an important step in reducing the burden of diabetes and its complications. Electronic health records (EHRs) for each individual or a population have become important tools in understanding developing trends of diseases. Using EHRs to predict the onset of diabetes could improve the quality and efficiency of medical care. In this paper, we apply a wide and deep learning model that combines the strength of a generalised linear model with various features and a deep feed-forward neural network to improve the prediction of the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).",89,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

GRAPE is hardware dedicated to the calculation of Coulombic or gravitational force among particles.

Since GRAPE can handle particle force only, just a small fraction of the calculation procedure can be put on it. The rest part must be performed on a conventional computer connected to GRAPE. In order to take full advantage of the dedicated hardware, we modified the FMM using Pseudoparticle Multipole Method and Anderson’s method. In our modified algorithm, multipole and local expansions are expressed by distribution of a small number of imaginary particles (pseudoparticles), and thus they can be evaluated by GRAPE.

1263,1488,Learning to classify short and sparse text & web with hidden topics from large-scale data collections,"This paper presents a general framework for building classifiers that deal with short and sparse text & Web segments by making the most of hidden topics discovered from large-scale data collections. The main motivation of this work is that many classification tasks working with short segments of text & Web, such as search snippets, forum & chat messages, blog & news feeds, product reviews, and book & movie summaries, fail to achieve high accuracy due to the data sparseness. We, therefore, come up with an idea of gaining external knowledge to make the data more related as well as expand the coverage of classifiers to handle future data better. The underlying idea of the framework is that for each classification task, we collect a large-scale external data collection called"" universal dataset"", and then build a classifier on both a (small) set of labeled training data and a rich set of hidden topics discovered from that …",102,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

The framework focuses on solving two main challenges posed by these kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better.

1265,1491,Vietnamese word segmentation with CRFs and SVMs: An investigation,"Word segmentation for Vietnamese, like for most Asian languages, is an important task which has a significant impact on higher language processing levels. However, it has received little attention of the community due to the lack of a common annotated corpus for evaluation and comparison. Also, most previous studies focused on unsupervised-statistical approaches or combined too many techniques. Consequently, their accuracies are not as high as expected. This paper reports a careful investigation of using conditional random fields (CRFs) and support vector machines (SVMs)-two of the most successful statistical learning methods in NLP and pattern recognition-for solving the task. We first build a moderate annotated corpus using different sources of materials. For a careful evaluation, different CRF and SVM models using different feature settings were trained and their results are compared and contrasted with each other. In addition, we discuss several important points about the accuracy, computational cost, corpus size and other aspects that might influence the overall quality of Vietnamese word segmentation.",102,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

In order to solve the task, we have proposed and investigated different strategies. Specifically, we consider this task as a regression problem and a rating prediction problem in recommender systems. To improve the performance of the former, we proposed the use of additional features based on course-related skills. Moreover, to effectively utilize the outputs of these two strategies, we also proposed a combination of the two methods to enhance the prediction performance. We evaluated the proposed methods on a dataset which was built using the mark data of students in information technology at Vietnam National University, Hanoi (VNU). The experimental results have demonstrated that unlike the PSP in e-Learning systems, the regression-based approach should give better performance than the recommender system-based approach. The integration of the proposed features also helps to enhance the performance of the regression-based systems. Overall, the proposed hybrid method achieved the best RMSE score of 1.668. These promising results are expected to provide students early feedbacks about their (predicted) performance on their future courses, and therefore saving times of students and their tutors in determining which courses are appropriate for students’ ability.",102,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

As in man, the sensitivity of the brain to lead toxicity is age-dependent. Pups given daily lead feedings for one week beginning in the first week of life show pathologic changes (ie, hemorrhage, edema, and neuronal necrosis) throughout the brain including the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Pups begun on daily lead feedings for two weeks between 10-18 days of age show similar pathologic changes almost entirely confined to the cerebellum. Pups receiving very large quantities of lead for two weeks beginning at 20 or 24 days of age develop only minimal edema or no changes by light microscopy. We have proposed that the effects of lead on cellular aerobic energy metabolism are important in the pathogenesis of the encephalopathy in the developing brain. Early in the course of lead feedings begun at 14 days of age, isolated cerebellar mitochondria show a loss of respiratory control. During the second week of lead feedings, respiration with NAD-linked substrates is inhibited in cerebellar mitochondria, but not in cerebral mitochondria, from these animals. Cerebral mitochondrial respiration in pups fed lead from birth also is inhibited while both cerebral and cerebellar mitochondrial respiration in lead-fed adults is not affected. Isolated brain mitochondria exposed to lead in vitro show similar changes; an initial respiratory stimulation (probably reflecting an energy-coupled uptake of lead) and a secondary inhibition of dehydrogenases located in the mitochondrial matrix.

Among outstanding synergistic drug nanoplatforms, thermosensitive copolymer heparin-Pluronic F127 (Hep-F127) co-delivering cisplatin (CDDP) and curcumins (Cur) (Hep-F127/CDDP/Cur) has emerged as a notable candidate for temperature-responsive drug delivery. The procedure was based on the entrapment of curcumin into the hydrophobic core of bio-degradable co-polymer Hep-F127 while the hydrophilic drug CDDP subsequently conjugated to the backbone heparin to form the core-shell structure. The copolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), to corroborate the successful synthesis and via HPLC along with AES-ICP to evaluate the high drug loading along with a controllable release from the nano-gels.

1340,1574,Rapid Assessment of Flood Inundation and Damaged Rice Area in Red River Delta from Sentinel 1A Imagery,"The Red River Delta (RRD), including 11 provinces, is one of the four largest rice-growing areas in Vietnam. Tropical storms often occur and cause serious flooding from May to October annually in the RRD, which strongly affects the productivity of the summer–autumn rice, one of two main rice crops. Therefore, the rapid assessment of damaged rice area by flooding inundation is critical for farmers and the government. In this study, we proposed a methodology for quick estimation of rice areas damaged by flooding using Sentinel 1A (S1A) imagery. Firstly, the latest rice map was produced. Then, a Near Real-Time (NRT) flood map, which is estimated from S1A images at the closest time to a flooding event, was generated by excluding the yearly permanent map from the temporal water map. Our experiment was conducted for the assessment of damaged rice area by flooding from the tropical storm named Son-Tinh, which happened on 19–21 July 2018. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was applied on time-series of S1A VV with VH data (VVVH) to obtain a rice map for the winter-spring season of 2018 with 90.5% Overall Accuracy (OA) and 2.37% difference (12,544 ha) from the General Statistics Office (GSO) of Vietnam’s reports for the whole region. Then, the Otsu thresholding method was applied for permanent water surface extraction and NRT flood mapping. The estimated damaged area was compared to available provincial and communal statistics for validation and further analysis. Right after the Son-Tinh storm, the estimation of inundated rice was approximately 50% of the total rice area in the RRD (271,092 ha).

However because of their wide variation a number of challenges still remain in terms of their identification and semantic normalisation before they can be fully exploited for research purposes. This paper presents novel techniques for identifying potential complex phenotype mentions by exploiting a hybrid model based on machine learning, rules and dictionary matching. A systematic study is made of how to combine sequence labels from these modules as well as the merits of various ontological resources. We evaluated our approach on a subset of Medline abstracts cited by the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database related to auto-immune diseases. Using partial matching the best micro-averaged F-score for phenotypes and five other entity classes was 79.9%. A best performance of 75.3% was achieved for phenotype candidates using all semantics resources. We observed the advantage of using SVM-based learn-to-rank for sequence label combination over maximum entropy and a priority list approach. The results indicate that the identification of simple entity types such as chemicals and genes are robustly supported by single semantic resources, whereas phenotypes require combinations.

Our approach combines various fast algorithms to generate a list of potential candidate trees. The key ingredient is the definition of so-called important quartets (IQs), which allow the computation of an intermediate tree in O(n2) time for n sequences. The resulting tree is then further optimized by applying the nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) operation. Subsequently a random fraction of the sequences is deleted from the best tree found so far. The deleted sequences are then re-inserted in the smaller tree using the important quartet puzzling (IQP) algorithm. These steps are repeated several times and the best tree, with respect to the likelihood criterion, is considered as the inferred phylogenetic tree.

1376,1610,MPBoot: fast phylogenetic maximum parsimony tree inference and bootstrap approximation,"The nonparametric bootstrap is widely used to measure the branch support of phylogenetic trees. However, bootstrapping is computationally expensive and remains a bottleneck in phylogenetic analyses. Recently, an ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) approach was proposed for maximum likelihood analyses. However, such an approach is still missing for maximum parsimony. To close this gap we present MPBoot, an adaptation and extension of UFBoot to compute branch supports under the maximum parsimony principle. MPBoot works for both uniform and non-uniform cost matrices. Our analyses on biological DNA and protein showed that under uniform cost matrices, MPBoot runs on average 4.7 (DNA) to 7 times (protein data) (range: 1.2–20.7) faster than the standard parsimony bootstrap implemented in PAUP*; but 1.6 (DNA) to 4.1 times (protein data) slower than the standard bootstrap with a fast search routine in TNT (fast-TNT). However, for non-uniform cost matrices MPBoot is 5 (DNA) to 13 times (protein data) (range:0.3–63.9) faster than fast-TNT. We note that MPBoot achieves better scores more frequently than PAUP* and fast-TNT. However, this effect is less pronounced if an intensive but slower search in TNT is invoked. Moreover, experiments on large-scale simulated data show that while both PAUP* and TNT bootstrap estimates are too conservative, MPBoot bootstrap estimates appear more unbiased. MPBoot provides an efficient alternative to the standard maximum parsimony bootstrap procedure. It shows favorable performance in terms of run time, the capability of finding a maximum parsimony tree, and high bootstrap …",111,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system 
1377,1611,"FLU, an amino acid substitution model for influenza proteins","The amino acid substitution model is the core component of many protein analysis systems such as sequence similarity search, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic inference. Although several general amino acid substitution models have been estimated from large and diverse protein databases, they remain inappropriate for analyzing specific species, e.g., viruses. Emerging epidemics of influenza viruses raise the need for comprehensive studies of these dangerous viruses. We propose an influenza-specific amino acid substitution model to enhance the understanding of the evolution of influenza viruses. A maximum likelihood approach was applied to estimate an amino acid substitution model (FLU) from ~113, 000 influenza protein sequences, consisting of ~20 million residues. FLU outperforms 14 widely used models in constructing maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for the majority of influenza protein alignments. On average, FLU gains ~42 log likelihood points with an alignment of 300 sites. Moreover, topologies of trees constructed using FLU and other models are frequently different. FLU does indeed have an impact on likelihood improvement as well as tree topologies. It was implemented in PhyML and can be downloaded from                    ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/1000genomes/lsq/FLU                                     or included in PhyML 3.0 server at                    http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/                                    .

The sterile insect technique (SIT) and the release of insects carrying a dominant lethal allele (RIDL) are two proposed methods for environmentally-friendly, species-targeted population control. These methods may be more suitable for developing countries if producers reduce the cost of rearing insects. The cost of control programs could be reduced by producing all-male mosquito populations to circumvent the isolation of females before release without reducing male mating competitiveness caused by transgenes. An RNAi construct targeting the RNA recognition motif of the Aedes aegypti transformer-2 (tra-2) gene does not trigger female-to-male sex conversion as commonly observed among dipterous insects. Instead, homozygous insects show greater mortality among m-chromosome-bearing sperm and mm zygotes, yielding up to 100 % males in the subsequent generations. The performance of transgenic males was not significantly different to wild-type males in narrow-cage competitive mating experiments. Our data provide preliminary evidence that the knockdown of Ae. aegypti tra-2 gene expression causes segregation distortion acting at the level of gametic function, which is reinforced by sex-specific zygotic lethality. This finding could promote the development of new synthetic sex distorter systems for the production of genetic sexing mosquito strains.",111,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

We propose a new distance-based clustering method, the shortest triplet clustering algorithm (STC), to reconstruct phylogenies.

Based on k-representative sets, shortest triplets are reconstructed and serve as building blocks for the STC algorithm to agglomerate sequences for tree reconstruction in O(n2) time for n sequences.

For this reduced subset the subtree is created faster and serves as a scaffold to construct the full tree. Because many minimal subsets exist the procedure is repeated several times and the best tree with respect to some optimality criterion is considered as the inferred phylogenetic tree.

1387,1621,"FastMG: a simple, fast, and accurate maximum likelihood procedure to estimate amino acid replacement rate matrices from large data sets","Amino acid replacement rate matrices are a crucial component of many protein analysis systems such as sequence similarity search, sequence alignment, and phylogenetic inference. Ideally, the rate matrix reflects the mutational behavior of the actual data under study; however, estimating amino acid replacement rate matrices requires large protein alignments and is computationally expensive and complex. As a compromise, sub-optimal pre-calculated generic matrices are typically used for protein-based phylogeny. Sequence availability has now grown to a point where problem-specific rate matrices can often be calculated if the computational cost can be controlled. The most time consuming step in estimating rate matrices by maximum likelihood is building maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees from protein alignments. We propose a new procedure, called FastMG, to overcome this obstacle. The key innovation is the alignment-splitting algorithm that splits alignments with many sequences into non-overlapping sub-alignments prior to estimating amino acid replacement rates. Experiments with different large data sets showed that the FastMG procedure was an order of magnitude faster than without splitting. Importantly, there was no apparent loss in matrix quality if an appropriate splitting procedure is used. FastMG is a simple, fast and accurate procedure to estimate amino acid replacement rate matrices from large data sets.

A genome can be considered as a sequence of characters (loci) which are genes or segments of nucleotides. Genomes are subject to both nucleotide transformation and character order rearrangement processes. In this context, we define a problem of so-called pairwise alignment with rearrangements (PAR) between two genomes. The PAR generalizes the ordinary pairwise alignment by allowing the rearrangement of character order. The objective is to find the optimal PAR that minimizes the total cost which is composed of three factors: the edit cost between characters, the deletion/insertion cost of characters, and the rearrangement cost between character orders. To this end, we propose simple and effective heuristic methods: character moving and simultaneous character swapping. The efficiency of the methods is tested on Metazoa mitochondrial genomes. Experiments show that, pairwise alignments with rearrangements give better performance than ordinary pairwise alignments without rearrangements. The best proposed method, simultaneous character swapping, is implemented as an essential subroutine in our software POY version 4.0 to reconstruct genome-based phylogenies.",111,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

1414,1655,Feature Extraction for Non-frontal Faces,"One of the most challenge tasks in building a face recognition system is how to represent and extract good quality features from face images. The difficulties come from variations in head poses, illumination conditions, and facial expression. Although many researches have been done, most were carried on under constrained environments. Most researches concentrated on dealing with frontal faces. Processing non-frontal faces encounters more challenge because some features on faces become occluded dramatically. In this paper, we propose two models to extract features from non-frontal faces in the range of 30o to 90o. First, we use the Viola-Jones detection method to identify the pose of face images. Then, we use Active Appearance Model (AAM) to interpret face images. Lastly, the models are trained to know how to fit new images. To improve the efficiency of fitting, we apply a nonlinear parameter update method. Experimental results show that using nonlinear fitting for non-frontal can increase the accuracy of the AAM fitting, compared with some previous methods.",117,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

1416,1665,Estimating searching cost of regular path queries on large graphs by exploiting unit-subqueries.,"Regular path queries (RPQs) are widely used on a graph whose answer is a set of tuples of nodes connected by paths corresponding to a given regular expression. Traditional automata-based approach for evaluating RPQs is restricted in the explosion of graph size, which makes graph searching take high cost (i.e. memory space and response time). Recently, a cost-based optimization technique using rare labels has been proved to be effective when it is applied to large graph. However, there is still a room for improvement, because the rare labels in the graph and/or the query are coarse information which could not guarantee the minimum searching cost all the time. This is our motivation to find a new approach using fine-grained information to estimate correctly the searching cost, which helps improving the performance of RPQs evaluation. For example, by using estimated searching cost, we can decompose an RPQ into small subqueries or separate multiple RPQs into small batch of queries in an efficient way for parallelism evaluation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for estimating the searching cost of RPQs on large graphs with cost functions based on the combinations of the searching cost of unit-subqueries (i.e. every smallest possible query). We extensively evaluated our method on real-world datasets including Alibaba, Yago, Freebase as well as synthetic datasets. Experimental results show that our estimation method obtains high accuracy which is approximately 87% on average. Moreover, two comparisons with automata-based and rare label based approaches demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional ones.",85,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

However, unlike other deep neural networks such as Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), few analyses such as verification and property inferences exist, potentially due to dynamic behaviors of GNNs, which can take arbitrary graphs as input, whereas FFNNs which only take fixed size numerical vectors as inputs.

This paper proposes an approach to analyze GNNs by converting them into FFNNs and reusing existing FFNNs analyses. We discuss various designs to ensure the scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We illustrate our method on a study case of node classification.

1419,1668,Usability and Aesthetics: Better Together for Automated Repair of Web Pages.,"With the recent explosive growth of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, guaranteeing consistent web appearance across all environments has become a significant problem. This happens simply because it is hard to keep track of the web appearance on different sizes and types of devices that render the web pages. Therefore, fixing the inconsistent appearance of web pages can be difficult, and the cost incurred can be huge, e.g., poor user experience and financial loss due to it. Recently, automated web repair techniques have been proposed to automatically resolve inconsistent web page appearance, focusing on improving usability. However, generated patches tend to disrupt the webpage's layout, rendering the repaired webpage aesthetically unpleasing, e.g., distorted images or misalignment of components.

In this paper, we propose an automated repair approach for web pages based on meta-heuristic algorithms that can assure both usability and aesthetics. The key novelty that empowers our approach is a novel fitness function that allows us to optimistically evolve buggy web pages to find the best solution that optimizes both usability and aesthetics at the same time. Empirical evaluations show that our approach is able to successfully resolve mobile-friendly problems in 94% of the evaluation subjects, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline techniques in terms of both usability and aesthetics.",85,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
1420,1669,Link-Intensive Alignment for Incomplete Knowledge Graphs.,"Knowledge graph (KG) alignment - the task of recognizing entities referring to the same thing in different KGs - is recognized as one of the most important operations in the field of KG construction and completion. However, existing alignment techniques often assume that the input KGs are complete and isomorphic, which is not true due to the real-world heterogeneity in the domain, size, and sparsity. In this work, we address the problem of aligning incomplete KGs with representation learning. Our KG embedding framework exploits two feature channels: transitivity-based and proximity-based. The former captures the consistency constraints between entities via translation paths, while the latter captures the neighbourhood structure of KGs via attention guided relation-aware graph neural network. The two feature channels are jointly learned to exchange important features between the input KGs while enforcing the output representations of the input KGs in the same embedding space. Also, we develop a missing links detector that discovers and recovers the missing links in the input KGs during the training process, which helps mitigate the incompleteness issue and thus improve the compatibility of the learned representations. The embeddings then are fused to generate the alignment result, and the high-confidence matched node pairs are updated to the pre-aligned supervision data to improve the embeddings gradually. Empirical results show that our model is more accurate than the SOTA and is robust against different levels of incompleteness.",85,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

1422,1671,Automated Test Input Generation via Model Inference Based on User Story and Acceptance Criteria for Mobile Application Development.,"There has been observed explosive growth in the development of mobile applications (apps) for Android and iOS operating systems, which has led to the direct impact towards mobile app development. In order to design and propose quality-oriented apps, it is the primary responsibility of developers to devote time and sufficient efforts towards testing to make the apps bug-free and operational in the hands of end-users without any hiccup. Manual testing procedures take a prolonged amount of time in writing test cases, and in some cases, the full testing requirements are not met. Besides, the insufficient knowledge of tester also impacts the overall quality and bug-free apps. To overcome the obstacles of testing, we propose a new testing methodology cum tool called “AgileUATM” which works primarily towards white-box and black-box testing. To evaluate the validity of the proposed tool, we put the tool in a real-time operational environment concerning mobile test apps. By using this tool, all the acceptance criteria are determined via user stories. The testers/developers specify requirements with formal specifications based on programs properties, predicates, invariants, and constraints. The results show that the proposed tool generated effective and accurate test cases, test input. Meanwhile, expected output was also generated in a unified fashion from the user stories to meet acceptance criteria. The proposed solution also reduced the development time to identify test data as compared to manual Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) methodologies. This tool can support the developers to get a better idea about the required tests and able to translate the customer’s natural languages to computer languages as well.

Therefore, a sustainable and effective rice paddy area monitoring is highly desirable, as the traditional methods are costly, inaccurate and requires heavy human-related workload. In this paper, we propose a novel rice monitoring framework using the satellite image, thanks to its high quality and free-to-access. Our framework first preprocesses the raw satellite image to alleviate the effect of adversarial factors such as geometric discrepancy and solar radiation. Then we design a deep learning model inspiring from u-net architecture to exploit simultaneously the spatial, spectral and temporal nature of satellite images.

1426,1675,Generating Test Data for Blackbox Testing from UML-Based Web Engineering Content and Presentation Models.,"Software testing is a process that produces and consumes huge amounts of data. Thus, the test data is usually either gathered manually by the testers or randomly generated by tools. The manual method consumes lot of time and highly depends on the testers’ experience while the random approach faces the problem of redundant test data caused by identical use cases. By leveraging the concept of Model-based testing, this paper provides a novel method of testing to save the cost of manual testing and to increase the reliability of the testing processes. In Model-based testing, test cases and test data can be derived from different models.

The diversity of IaaS and PaaS services from many cloud providers gives customers many choices that benefit them the most. If a customer is not satisfied with his existing cloud resource service (IaaS or PaaS), he is going to stop using the service in use and consider other cloud service providers. And he also wants his cloud software bought on the market to be hosted on new cloud platforms. However, changing cloud resource services for multi-cloud application is not trivial. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses a Composable Application Model (CAM) to construct the topology of a multi-cloud application in a Blueprint. Thereby, all the changes of cloud platform services are reflected to the Blueprint. In this way, the cloud application is managed. Thus, cloud application operation is guaranteed after one or several of its software components are re-deployed on new cloud platform services and re-established application interconnections so that the operation of the cloud application is as an initial state. For updating the Blueprint, we built a bidirectional transformation system where the core is a bidirectional transformation program.

1437,1686,Risk Management in Agile Software Project Iteration Scheduling Using Bayesian Networks.,"Agile Software Development methods have been largely adopted in the last ten years since they have certain advantages over the traditional approaches. However, industrial software development processes are getting more and more complex and dynamic. As a consequence, optimization of software project scheduling has always been big challenges in both practice and academia, even with Agile methods. There is always uncertainty as well as a need for a probabilistic method that better model and predict uncertainty in software projects. This paper proposes Bayesian Networks to model risk factors in Agile software projects as well as managing risks in Agile iteration scheduling. The paper also addresses 19 common risk factors that affect iteration scheduling. Based on the method, a software was developed as a support tool for managers to control their project schedules as it can assess the possibility of each schedule.",85,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

1440,1690,Applying PNZ Model in Reliability Prediction of Component-Based Systems and Fault Tolerance Structures Technique.,"Reliability is the chief quality that one wishes for in anything. Reliability is also the main issue with computer systems. One of the purposes of system reliability analysis is to identify the weakness in a system and to quantify the impact of component failures. However, existing reliability prediction approaches for component-based software systems are limited in their applicability because they either neglect or do not support modeling explicitly several factors like error propagation, software fault tolerance mechanisms. In this paper, we evaluate reliability prediction of component-based system and fault tolerance structures technique by applying Pham Nordmann Zhang (PNZ) model, one of the best models based on non homogeneous Poisson process. Our approach uses a reliability modeling schema whose models are automatically transformed by a reliability prediction tool into PNZ models for reliability predictions and sensitivity analyses.

Engineers require a design description which is easy to understand. SysML provides diagrammatic notations which are independent of specific disciplines. To express numerical constraints of SysML diagrams, we extend OCL with real arithmetic. Both SysML and extended-OCL require an executable design language to check inconsistencies of constraints. To achieve the above idea, we bridge a gap between SysML and VDM-RT. We propose a framework to embed SysML/extended-OCL into VDM-RT, where we prepare some libraries for extended-OCL. It is unnecessary for engineers to know VDM-RT. Using a unified CPS design description, our approach automatically debugs inconsistencies in whole CPS design.

1450,1709,A Consensus-Based Load-Balancing Algorithm for Sharded Blockchains.,"Public blockchains are decentralized networks where each participating node executes the same decision-making process. This form of decentralization does not scale well because the same data are stored on each network node, and because all nodes must validate each transaction prior to their confirmation. One solution approach decomposes the nodes of a blockchain network into subsets called “shards”, each shard processing and storing disjoint sets of transactions in parallel. To fully benefit from the parallelism of sharded blockchains, the processing load of shards must be evenly distributed. However, the problem of computing balanced workloads is theoretically hard and further complicated in practice as transaction processing times are unknown prior to be assigned to shards. In this paper we introduce a dynamic workload-balancing algorithm where the allocation strategy of transactions to shards is periodically adapted based on the recent workload history of shards. Our algorithm is an adaptation to sharded blockchains of a consensus-based load-balancing algorithm. It is a fully distributed algorithm inline with network based applications such as blockchains. Some preliminary results are reported based on simulations that shard transactions of three well-known blockchain platforms.",86,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

In the literature, there exists few approaches deriving finite time convergence for discrete consensus algorithms. In this paper we focus on an analysis of finite time convergence based on the observability matrix for consensus networks. We introduce analytical results extending the applicability of network observability theory to consensus and other distributed algorithms. New analytical bounds on the number of steps to compute consensus are provided as well as counterexamples which are disproving a conjecture on the minimum of steps to compute consensus. A polynomial time algorithm is described to calculate empirically the exact number of steps to compute consensus values. We have implemented a consensus-based network intrusion detection system based on the observability matrix approach of consensus networks. This implementation validates empirically our analytical results. We also compare the performance of the finite time consensus with an implementation of the same intrusion detection system using asymptotic consensus. Although the finite time algorithm provides exact solutions, tests show that it needs less iterations to obtain a consensus solution.",86,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

1459,1720,Scheduled service network design with resource acquisition and management.,"We present a new planning model for freight consolidation carriers, one that links strategic, resource acquisition, and allocation decisions with tactical, service network design-related decisions. Specifically, such as service network design models that recognize resource constraints, the model selects services and routes both commodities and the resources needed to support the services that transport them. In addition, the model recognizes that resources can be grouped into types that differ from one another with respect to capabilities, e.g., speeds, capacities, scheduling rules, etc. Ultimately, along with recognizing resource constraints, the model also makes strategic decisions such as how many resources of each type should be acquired, to what terminal new resources should be assigned, and which existing terminal-based resources should be reassigned. As such, the model can be used from a strategic planning, resource acquisition, mixing, and allocation perspective as it provides an estimate of the impact of such decisions on transportation costs. We extend a matheuristic for a service network design problem with a fixed set (both in number and allocation) of resources of a single type to one that can also make these acquisition and allocation decisions for multiple types of resource. Then, with an extensive computational study, we demonstrate the efficacy of the matheuristic and benchmark its performance against both a leading commercial solver and a column generation-based heuristic.

1460,1721,Applicability and Resilience of a Linear Encoding Scheme for Computing Consensus.,Consensus algorithms have a set of network nodes converge asymptotically to a same state which depends on some function of their initial states. At the core of these algorithms is a linear iterative scheme where each node updates its current state based on its previous state and the state of its neighbors in the network. In this paper we review a proposal from control theory which uses linear iterative schemes of asymptotic consensus and observability theory to compute consensus states in a finite number of iterations. This proposal has low communication requirements which makes it attractive to address consensus problems in a limited resource environment such as edge computing. However it assumes static networks contrary to wireless edge computing networks which are often dynamic and prone to attacks.

NIDSs can also be part of the a　ected network facilities and be the subject of attacks aiming at degrading their detection capabilities. The present paper investigates such vulnerabilities in a recent consensus-based NIDS proposal [1]. This system uses an average consensus algorithm to share information among the NIDS modules and to develop coordinated responses to network intrusions. It is known however that consensus algorithms are not resilient to compromised nodes sharing falsied information, i.e. they can be the target of Byzantine attacks. Our work proposes two di　erent strategies aiming at identifying compromised NIDS modules sharing falsied information. Also, a simple approach is proposed to isolate compromised modules, returning the NIDS into a non-compromised state. Validations of the defense strategies are provided through several simulations of Distributed Denial of Service attacks using the NSL-KDD data set. The eciency of the proposed methods at identifying compromised NIDS nodes and maintaining the accuracy of the NIDS is compared.

In this initial work, modules of the NIDS repeatedly average their state with the state of their neighbors to converge asymptotically to a same value, which in turn is used as measurement of some relevant state of the network wide monitored traffic. In the present work, local averaging is used to implement a finite convergence procedure for the consensus-based NIDS in [1]. We call this implementation exact consensus as local averaging computes exactly in a finite number of steps a function of the initial NIDS states. Furthermore, unlike asymptotic consensus which computed only the average sum function, this new distributed protocol can compute almost any function of the initial NIDS states. Tests are performed that compare the asymptotic consensus with this new exact consensus protocol. In particular, we compare the convergence speed of the two methods given a same pre-defined level of accuracy in the decisions computed by the intrusion detection system.",86,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

We consider both naive (independent) and colluding attackers. We test three defense strategy implementations, two classified as outlier detection methods and one reputation-based method. We have narrowed our attention to outlier and reputation-based methods because they are relatively light computationally speaking. We have left out control theoretic methods which are likely the most effective methods, however their computational cost increase rapidly with the number of attackers.

Most of the current available flood mitigation approaches are using data from fixed-site sensor systems which are not only costly but also limited in their coverage. Crowdsourcing is one of the potential approaches for addressing the coverage issue where flood data is collected and shared by crowds available everywhere. However, existing crowdsourcing-based approaches to flood mitigation systems lack thorough solutions on data validity. This paper proposes an appropriate crowdsourced data validity scheme which relies on both the scores evaluated by other users in the crowds and the accumulated reputation obtained by the user who shares the data.

This meta-heuristic is a generational genetic algorithm that uses two neighborhood-based meta-heuristics to optimize offspring. Local search methods have previously been proposed to enhance the fitness of offspring generated by crossover operators. In the proposed method, neighborhood-based meta-heuristics are used for their capacity to escape local optima, and deliver optimized and diversified solutions to the population of the next generation. Furthermore, the search performed by the neighborhood-based meta-heuristics repairs most of the constraint violations that naturally occur after the application of the crossover operators. The genetic algorithm we propose introduces two new crossover operators addressing the periodic vehicle routing problem with time windows. The two crossover operators are seeking the diversification of the exploration in the solution space from solution recombination, while simultaneously aiming not to destroy information about routes in the population as computing routes is NP-hard.

A diversification strategy, guided by an elite solution set and a frequency-based memory, is also used to drive the search to potentially unexplored good regions and, hopefully, enhance the solution quality. Extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with the literature show that the proposed tabu search yields very high quality solutions, improving those currently published.",86,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

The proposed matheuristic combines exact and neighbourhood-based methods. Tabu search and restricted path relinking meta-heuristics cooperate to generate as many feasible solutions as possible. The two meta-heuristics incorporate new neighbourhoods, and computationally efficient exploration procedures. The feasible solutions generated by the two procedures are then used to identify an appropriate part of the solution space where an exact solver intensifies the search. Computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the proposed algorithm finds good solutions to large-scale problems in a reasonable amount of time.",86,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

The model relies on p-cycles in order to protect the inter-domain links, while FIPP p-cycles are used for the protection in each individual domain, and for the virtual links in between the inter-domain links. Experiments were successfully conducted on a multi-domain network with 5 domains.

1474,1735,A multilevel tabu search algorithm for the feature selection problem in biomedical data.,"The automated analysis of patients’ biomedical data can be used to derive diagnostic and prognostic inferences about the observed patients. Many noninvasive techniques for acquiring biomedical samples generate data that are characterized by a large number of distinct attributes (i.e., features) and a small number of observed patients (i.e., samples). Using these biomedical data to derive reliable inferences, such as classifying a given patient as either cancerous or noncancerous, requires that the ratio  of the number of samples to the number of features be within the range . To satisfy this requirement, the original set of features in the biomedical data has to be reduced to an ‘optimal’ subset of features that most enhances the classification of the observed patients. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection technique (multilevel feature selection) that seeks the ‘optimal’ feature subset in biomedical data using a multilevel search algorithm. This algorithm combines a hierarchical search framework with a tabu search method. The framework consists of increasingly coarse forms (i.e., search subspaces) of the original feature space that are strategically and progressively explored by the tabu search method. The result of the search at any given coarse subspace is used to initialize the search at the previous less coarse subspace. We evaluate the performance of the proposed technique in terms of the solution quality, using experiments that compare the classification inferences derived from the solution found, with those derived from other feature selection techniques such as the sequential forward selection, random feature selection and tabu search feature selection. An equivalent amount of computational resource is allocated to the evaluated techniques to provide a common basis for comparison. The empirical results show that the multilevel feature selection technique finds ‘optimal’ subsets that enable more accurate and stable classification than those obtained by using the other feature selection techniques.",86,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

This variation restricts the problem to bipartite graphs and asks, for a fixed integer K, whether or not the graph contains a spanning tree with at least K leaves in one of the partite sets. We show not only that this problem is NP-complete, but that it remains NP-complete for planar bipartite graphs of maximum degree 4.

Tabu search finds “good” approximations of covering designs in each search space. Blocks from those approximate solutions are transferred to other levels, redefining the corresponding search spaces. The dynamics of cooperation among levels tends to regroup good approximate solutions into small search spaces. Tabu search has been quite effective at finding re-combinations of blocks in small search spaces which provide successful search directions in larger search spaces.",86,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

This cooperation mechanism strongly impacts how the solution space is explored. We introduce a formal representation of such cooperative procedures based on discrete-time dynamical systems.

The authors present a cooperative multilevel search algorithm CoMHP and describe a parallel implementation on the SGI O2000 system.

Bisections of hypergraphs based on the algorithm also outperform hMETIS, although more modestly. The authors present experimental results to demonstrate that the cooperation scheme plays a key role in the performance of CoMHP. In fact, the improvement in the quality of the solutions produced by CoMHP is to a large extent independent of the partitioners used in the implementation of CoMHP.

More specifically, the necessity to acquire or trade resources as a bundle (i.e., perform co-allocation) presents a challenge to traditional bidding mechanisms.

1484,1749,Global optimization properties of parallel cooperative search algorithms: A simulation study.,"Cooperative search is a parallelization strategy where parallelism is obtained by concurrently executing several search programs for the same optimization problem instance. The programs cooperate by exchanging information on previously explored regions of the solution space. When the sharing of information overlaps among several programs, changes in the search behavior of one program can propagate over time to several other programs; this is a process called diffusion in physical systems. The optimization properties of diffusion dynamics in cooperative algorithms have not been formally established. However, it is generally believed that when the selection of shared information is biased by the cost (objective) function, diffusion dynamics help to improve the search of cooperating programs. In this study, we simulate this aspect of cooperative algorithms using cellular automata (CAs) (these are artificial dynamical systems often used to simulate the dynamics of complex systems). Our results show that the sharing of information based on the cost function does not affect the diffusion dynamics and therefore does not seem to help the optimization strategy of cooperating programs. However, this study increases our understanding of the role played by diffusion processes in cooperative algorithms. We suggest new approaches that can help to subordinate diffusion dynamics to the optimization goals of the search programs.",86,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

The solution space is implicitly decomposed according to the search strategy of each program. The programs cooperate by exchanging information on previously explored regions of the solution space. In this paper we propose a new design for cooperative search algorithms which is also a new parallel problem solving paradigm for combinatorial optimization problems. Our new design is based on an innovative approach to decompose the solution space which is inspired from the modeling of cooperative algorithms based on dynamical systems theory. Our design also gives a new purpose to the sharing of information among cooperating tasks based on principles borrowed from scatter search evolutionary algorithms. We have applied this paradigm to the graph partitioning problem.

At run time, the data gathered in the memory by one sequential search program need not be used only by this program, but it can be recycled and shared with other concurrently executing tabu search programs for the same purpose. In this paper we compare the global behavior of cooperating and non-cooperating tabu search programs. We show that cooperating programs tend to have a search pattern which is less diversified than non-cooperating programs. Our findings also indicate that this second order impact of the sharing of gathered data on the search behaviors of cooperating programs is not related to the optimization properties of the individual tabu programs.",86,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

This paper proposes a distributed control law for two-dimensional multiple agents considered as arbitrarily polygonal shapes under limited communication ranges. The proposed control laws guarantee all flocking properties: each agent stays close to its nearby neighbours, no collision occurs in group of agents and velocity of each agent converges to a common vector. The designed control law based on a new anti-collision condition and potential function approach aims at dealing with the issue of collisions between agents. Further, the control signals are bounded and differentiable despite of agent's limited communication ranges and non-smooth boundary in agent shapes.

This proposed antenna consisted of four sequentially rotated dual-dipoles, fed by a hybrid feeding network with equal amplitude and an incremental 90° phase delay. The feeding network was composed of three Wilkinson power dividers and Schiffman phase shifters.

The four classifiers were chosen because they are considered to have high accuracy, however, their use in mangrove age and species classifications has thus far been limited. A time-series of Landsat images from 1975 to 2019 was used to map mangrove extent changes using the unsupervised classification method of iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) and a comparison with accuracy of K-means classification, which found that mangrove extent has increased, despite a fall in the 1980s, indicating the success of mangrove plantation and forest protection efforts by local people in the study area. To evaluate the supervised image classifiers, 183 in situ training plots were assessed, 70% of them were used to train the supervised algorithms, with 30% of them employed to validate the results. In order to improve mangrove species separations, Gram–Schmidt and principal component analysis image fusion techniques were applied to generate better quality images. All supervised and unsupervised (2019) results of mangrove age, species, and extent were mapped and accuracy was evaluated. Confusion matrices were calculated showing that the classified layers agreed with the ground-truth data where most producer and user accuracies were greater than 80%. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients (around 0.9) indicated that the image classifications were very good. The test showed that SVM was the most accurate, followed by DT, ANN, and RF in this case study.

1504,1773,Structured content-aware discovery for improving XML data consistency.,"With the explosive growth of heterogeneous XML sources, data inconsistency has become a serious problem that leads to ineffective business operations and poor decision-making. To address such inconsistency, XML functional dependencies (XFDs) have been proposed to constrain the data integrity of a source. Unfortunately, existing approaches to XFDs have insufficiently addressed data inconsistency arising from both semantic and structural inconsistencies inherent in heterogeneous XML data sources. This paper proposes a novel approach, called SCAD, to discover anomalies from a given source, which is essential to address prevalent inconsistencies in XML data. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce a new type of path and value-based data constraint, called XML Conditional Structural Dependency (XCSD), whereby (i) the paths in XCSD approximately represent groups of similar paths in sources to express constraints on objects with diverse structures; while (ii) the values bound to particular elements express constraints with conditional semantics. XCSD can capture data inconsistency disregarded by XFDs. Second, our proposed SCAD is used to discover XCSDs from a given source. Our approach exploits the semantics of data structures to detect similar paths from the sources, from which a data summary is constructed as an input for the discovery process. This aims to avoid returning redundant data rules due to structural inconsistencies. During the discovery process, SCAD employs semantics hidden in the data values to discover XCSDs. To evaluate our proposed approach, experiments and case studies were conducted on synthetic datasets which contain structural diversity causing XML data inconsistency. The experimental results show that SCAD can discover more dependencies and the dependencies found convey more meaningful semantics than those of the existing XFDs.",89,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

They typically start with a simple idea about the applications of their interest; and to complete these applications, they often face two key problems: (i) the lack of a systematic method for exploring ideas and (ii) the lack of a method for organizing activities to keep balance between learning, designing and coding. Unfortunately, existing approaches have inadequately address these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named MobiPDA, to mobile application development targeting non-professional developers. Our systematic approach provides (i) conceptual tools for exploring an initial idea from different perspectives and (ii) an activities-organization process to apply these tools in software projects. We performed a comparative analysis with Mobile-D and Mobia, and evaluated MobiPDA on two pilot software projects.",89,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
1508,1777,A grid-based multistage algorithm for parameter simulation-optimization of complex system.,"Evolutionary algorithms (EA) are recently used to explore the parameter space of complex system simulations as the methodology sees models as black boxes. The first advantage is that these algorithms become independent from what kind of simulation has to be explored. The task is finding the parameter settings to optimize a given objective function. This optimization process evaluates the performance of possible parameter sets and converges towards the best alternatives. The evaluation needs to launch hundreds of thousands of simulation runs. This procedure copes with the combinatorial explosion of computation time and requires considerable computational resources. Furthermore, the original algorithms cannot guarantee the exploration in the search space uniformly and equally because the search is probabilistic. This work elaborates a multistage optimization process in a grid-enabled modeling and simulation platform. We propose a hybrid integration of various continuous optimization algorithms and optimize them for running with different Distributed Resource Management (DRM) systems. The performance of algorithm is compared to original algorithm in the optimization of Ants model.",89,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

It allows to impose restrictions when we proceed to the next level and discover only most interesting negative association rules among the vast number of possible negative association rules. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for mining negative association rules by considering that items are organized in a hierarchy, and this hierarchy is reflected on the association rules we produce. In this way, we can mine for both general and specialized rules of negative association between items.",89,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
1510,1780,FPGA-based fuzzy sliding mode control for sensorless PMSM drive.,"This paper presents an observer-based fuzzy sliding mode controller for sensorless Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drive based on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. For enhancement of robustness, a sliding mode observer (SMO) is proposed to estimate first the current and back electromotive force (EMF), then to derive the flux angle. These estimated values together with the computed rotor speed of the motor are fed back for the control purpose in both the current loop and the speed loop. To cope with dynamic uncertainty and external load, a fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) is designed by incorporating a fuzzy inference mechanism into the proposed sliding mode control scheme to tune the discontinunous gain in the speed control loop. An FPGA chip is designed for implementing the vector-controlled current loop as well as the speed control loop. The very high speed integrated circuit-hardware description language (VHDL) is adopted to describe advantageous behaviors of the proposed control system. By integrating advantages of the sensorless and fuzzy sliding mode control techniques into the speed controller of a PMSM drive, its performance can be substantially enhanced while improving cost-effectiveness and reliability. The validity of the proposed approach is verified through results based on the VDHL Modelsim and Simulink co-simulation method.",89,7,based using model vietnamese data system algorithm search mobile problem optimization recognition routing networks analysis 
1511,1781,Double-layered schema integration of heterogeneous XML sources.,"Schema integration aims to create a mediated schema as a unified representation of existing heterogeneous sources sharing a common application domain. These sources have been increasingly written in XML due to its versatility and expressive power. Unfortunately, these sources often use different elements and structures to express the same concepts and relations, thus causing substantial semantic and structural conflicts. Such a challenge impedes the creation of high-quality mediated schemas and has not been adequately addressed by existing integration methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named XINTOR, for automating the integration of heterogeneous schemas. Given a set of XML sources and a set of correspondences between the source schemas, our method aims to create a complete and minimal mediated schema: it completely captures all of the concepts and relations in the sources without duplication, provided that the concepts do not overlap. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we resolve structural conflicts inherent in the source schemas. Second, we introduce a new statistics-based measure, called path cohesion, for selecting concepts and relations to be a part of the mediated schema. The path cohesion is statistically computed based on multiple path quality dimensions such as average path length and path frequency. Third, we resolve semantic conflicts by augmenting the semantics of similar concepts with context-dependent information. Finally, we propose a novel double-layered mediated schema to retain a wider range of concepts and relations than existing mediated schemas, which are at best either complete or minimal, but not both. Performed on both real and synthetic datasets, our experimental results show that XINTOR outperforms existing methods with respect to (i) the mediated-schema quality using precision, recall, F-measure, and schema minimality; and (ii) the execution performance based on execution time and scale-up performance.",89,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method 
1512,1782,Improving Retake Detection by Adding Motion Feature.,"Retake detection is useful for many applications of video summarization. It is a challenging task since different takes of the same scene are usually of different lengths; or have been recorded under different environment conditions. A general approach to solve this problem is to decompose the input video sequence into sub-sequences and then group these sub-sequences into clusters. By combining with temporal information, the clustering result is used to find take and scene boundaries. One of the most difficult steps in this approach is to cluster sub-sequences. Most of previous approaches only use one keyframe for representing one sub-sequence and extract features such as color and texture from this keyframe for clustering. We propose another approach to improve the performance by combining the motion feature extracted from each sub-sequence and the features extracted from each representing keyframe. Experiments evaluated on the standard benchmark dataset of TRECVID BBC Rushes 2007 show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",89,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

Current approaches to schema mediation require much improvement. First, they do not cope well with a large number of schemas since most involve repeating pairwise integration. Second, they do not provide sufficiently flexible solution because most mediated schemas commit to some particular choice regarding the representation of relationships between elements. This paper proposes a novel schema mediation approach, called XMediator, to address these problems. It exploits the structural properties of XML schemas, and generates a mediated schema from multiple schema sources.

The problem of structural diversity in XML design (e.g. nesting discrepancy and backward paths) makes it difficult to reformulate the queries. Therefore, we highlight the importance of precise query rewriting using composite concepts and relations of the mediated schema.

XMiner discovers frequent substructures using frequent subtree mining algorithms, and then constructs a mediated schemas. XMiner aims to preserve the hierarchical structure as the best as possible while avoiding information loss.

At the conceptual level, objects, their inter‐relationships and constraints are semantically powered by object‐oriented models. At the schema level, these conceptual semantics are comprehensively represented in textbased representation of XML Schema using various schema components and design styles, each of which offers different quality characteristics. Two primary design styles in use are nesting and linking. The nesting design styles are developed based on the choice of schema components and their definition/declaration scopes (global vs. local), whereas the linking design styles use referencing facilities provided by XML Schema and other XML technologies such as XLink and XPointer. With an in‐depth analysis of outstanding problems of existing approaches, the proposed design approach is motivated to help improve the quality and robustness of the XML documents in large‐scale XML‐based applications.",89,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

The second phase then uses these leaders to jointly calculate the final results by using the soft voting ensemble method. The two objective functions used here are predictive error and particle diversity. The empirical data used in this study are six different sets of currency exchange rates.

1521,1795,A novel evolutionary multi-objective ensemble learning approach for forecasting currency exchange rates.,"Due to the potential impact of the (currency) exchange rate risk in the financial market, forecasting exchange rate (FET) has become a hot topic in both academic and practical worlds. For many years, the various methods have been proposed and used for FET problems including the method of the artificial neural network (ANN). However, in many cases of FET, there is the limitation of using separate methods since they are not able to fully capture financial characteristics. Recently, more researchers have been beginning to pay attention to FET based on an ensemble of forecasting models (in other words, the combination of individual methods). Previous studies of ensemble methods have shown that the performance of an ensemble depends on two key elements (1) The individual performance and (2) diversity degree of base learners. The main idea behind this paper comes from these key elements, the authors use ANNs as the base method (or weak learners), and weights of these ANNs will be optimized by using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) including the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and the Non-Dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) using directional information. To assist MOEAs, a number of diversity-preservation mechanisms are used to generate diverse sets of base classifiers and finally we propose to use modified Adaboost algorithms to combine the results of weak learners for overall forecasts. The results show that the proposed novel ensemble learning approach can achieve higher forecasting performance than those of individual ones.",92,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

In this paper, we propose several transfer learning methods for Genetic Programming (GP). These methods were implemented by transferring a number of good individuals or sub-individuals from the source to the target problem. They were tested on two families of symbolic regression problems. The experimental results showed that transfer learning methods help GP to achieve better training errors.

The experimental results show that while using validation sets barely improve generalisation ability of GP, by using semantics, the performance of Genetic Programming is enhanced both on training and testing data. Further recorded statistics shows that the size of the evolved solutions by using SSC are often smaller than ones obtained from GP systems that do not use semantics.

1531,1806,Investigation of Micro-volume Viscosity with Janus Microbeads Based on Rotational Brownian Motion.,"Viscosity is an important property of liquids. A viscosity change of aqueous substances that deviates from their normal levels usually implies a compromise in quality due to degradation or microorganism proliferation. Monitoring of macro-scale viscosity can be simply realized by various conventional tools, such as rotational viscometers, capillary tubes, falling bodies, and so forth. Nevertheless, today, micro-volume viscosity measurement remains a challenging endeavor, resulting in rare, expensive, or difficult-to-obtain samples not very well studied. For this reason, a novel technique for micro-viscosity based on rotational Brownian motion is presented in this paper. Janus microbeads were made by coating fluorescent polystyrene beads with gold film. Taking advantage of the bead configuration of half gold/half fluorescence, the rotational Brownian signal was expressed in terms of blinking fluorescent intensity. The characteristic correlation time was derived from the blinking intensity of trace amounts of a selected medium over a certain time period, and results were correlated with viscosity. Given a volume of only 2 μL for each measurement, calibration of a series of glycerol–water mixtures (100%–1% (v/v) water content) yielded good agreement with the expected viscosity predictions over the range of 0.8–574.8 cP. Five common oil products, including lubricant oil, baby oil, food oil, olive oil, and motor oil, were further investigated to demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed technique. Data measured by the rotational Brownian motion-based diffusometer were comparable with those measured by a commercial rotational viscometer. The method also explicitly showed viscosity degradation after the oils were heated at a high temperature of over 100 °C for 10 min. Evaluation proved the proposed Janus microbead-enabled rotational diffusometric technique to be a promising approach for rapid and micro-scale viscosity measurement.

IFRS used the intuitionistic fuzzy similarity degree (IFSD) regarded as the generalization of the hard user-based, item-based and the rating-based similarity degrees in recommender systems to calculate the analogousness between patients in the system. In this paper, we firstly extend IFRS by using a new term - the intuitionistic fuzzy vector (IFV) instead of the existing intuitionistic fuzzy matrix (IFM) in IFRS. Then, the intuitionistic value similarity measure (IvSM) and the intuitionistic vector similarity measure (IVSM) are defined on the basis of the intuitionistic fuzzy vector. Some mathematical properties of these new terms are examined, and several IVSM functions are proposed.

1543,1820,Sender - Receiver cooperation and buffer observation for fine-grained adaptive transmission of video over mobile ad hoc networks.,"Deployment of video communication services over mobile ad hoc networks faces numerical obstacles since the networks are characterized by limited and unpredictable bandwidth. Following the tenet of service-orientation, this study proposes a cross-layer design for fine-grained adaptive transmission of real-time video over time-varying channels. Specifically, the sender accurately estimates the current effective bandwidth by observing its transmission buffer and negative acknowledgments (NACKs) from the receiver. Information on route quality provided by routing protocols may also be exploited to control the real-time stream efficiently. At the same time, the sender handles NACK messages to predict route goodness and orders retransmissions for improving video quality. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed design by both simulations and experiments of ad hoc nodes delivering H264/AVC, which consistently demonstrated the soundness and feasibility of the framework with respect to video quality and resource utilization.",99,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

How a component will be used is specified in its interface. Real-time interfaces are interfaces with timing constraints relating the time of outputs with the time of inputs. The timing constraint of an interface may depend on the resource availability for the component. In this paper, we propose a general model for real-time interfaces. At a time during execution, an interface behaves according to a contract made with environment about its functionality as well as execution time to fulfill the contract. This contract is specified as a timed design using the UTP notations, and depends on the computation histories of the interface. We model this dependence as a partial function from computation histories of the interface to real-time contracts. How interfaces are composed to form new interfaces, how interfaces are refined, and how to represent interfaces finitely are also considered in this paper. We show that checking the consistency between an environment and an interface and checking the refinement between two interfaces when they are represented by an automaton can be done effectively.",104,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

1573,1853,A novel efficient two-phase algorithm for training interpolation radial basis function networks.,"Interpolation radial basis function (RBF) networks have been widely used in various applications. The output layer weights are usually determined by minimizing the sum-of-squares error or by directly solving interpolation equations. When the number of interpolation nodes is large, these methods are time consuming, difficult to control the balance between the convergence rate and the generality, and difficult to reach a high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm for training interpolation RBF networks with bell-shaped basis functions. In the first phase, the width parameters of basis functions are determined by taking into account the tradeoff between the error and the convergence rate. Then, the output layer weights are determined by finding the fixed point of a given contraction transformation. The running time of this new algorithm is relatively short and the balance between the convergence rate and the generality is easily controlled by adjusting the involved parameters, while the error is made as small as desired. Also, its running time can be further enhanced thanks to the possibility to parallelize the proposed algorithm.

In that field, precision feeding is widely acknowledged because of its potential to reduce feed costs, environmental footprint and to improve animal health and welfare. Precision feeding involves modern multidisciplinary technologies such as information technology, mechanics, electronics, automation, etc. Such a system consists of automatic troughs linked to a computer system to exploit data collected from the individual animals (e.g. body weight, feed intake and feeding behaviour), and/or from ambient sensors. Data is processed and analysed based on mathematical models to make predictions, warnings for farmers or to formulate diets that fit requirements of each individual animal at each production period. However, implementing such a system often requires high investment, which may go beyond the capabilities of smallholders and small/medium laboratories. Furthermore, the risk of implementing by design but not conforming to reality is very high.

1576,1857,D-AVTree: DHT-Based Search System to Support Scalable Multi-Attribute Queries.,"Abstract At present, vast numbers of information resources are available on the Internet. However, one emerging issue is how to search and exploit these information resources in an efficient and flexible manner with high scalability. In this study, we focused our attention on the design of a distributed hash table (DHT)-based search system that supports efficient scalable multi-attribute queries of information resources in a distributed manner. Our proposed system, named D-AVTree, is built on top of a ring-based DHT, which partitions a one-dimensional key space across nodes in the system. It utilizes a descriptive naming scheme, which names each resource using an attribute-value (AV) tree, and the resource names are mapped to d-bit keys in order to distribute the resource information to responsible nodes based on a DHT routing algorithm. Our mapping scheme maps each AV branch of a resource name to a d-bit key where AV branches that share a subsequence of AV pairs are mapped to a continuous portion of the key space. Therefore, our mapping scheme ensures that the number of resources distributed to a node is small and it facilitates efficient multi-attribute queries by querying only a small number of nodes. Further, the scheme has good compatibility with key-based load balancing algorithms for DHT-based networks. Our system can achieve both efficiency and a good degree of load balancing even when the distribution of AV pairs in the resource names is skewed. Our simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of our solution in terms of the distribution cost, query hit ratio, and the degree of load balancing compared with conventional approaches.",107,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

Finally, it ranks tweets in each topic to extract important tweets for the user’s quick scan. For ranking, the framework utilizes event extraction to enrich the semantics and reduce the noise of tweets. After that, the framework builds event graphs for ranking to find out important tweets.

Global features of the fingerprints (e.g., singular core and delta points) can be used as the anchor to speed up the matching process. Most approaches use the conventional Poincare Index method with additional techniques to improve the detection of the core and delta points. Our approach uses Convolution Neural Networks which gained state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks to automatically detect those points.

1611,1892,Bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy description logics under the Gödel semantics.,"Description logics (DLs) are a suitable formalism for representing knowledge about domains in which objects are described not only by attributes but also by binary relations between objects. Fuzzy extensions of DLs can be used for such domains when data and knowledge about them are vague and imprecise. One of the possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In DLs and their fuzzy extensions, such equivalence relations can be used for concept learning. In this paper, we define and study fuzzy bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics, as well as crisp bisimulation and strong bisimilarity for such logics extended with involutive negation. The considered logics are fuzzy extensions of the DL  (a variant of PDL) with additional features among inverse roles, nominals, (qualified or unqualified) number restrictions, the universal role, local reflexivity of a role and involutive negation. We formulate and prove results on invariance of concepts under fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation, conditional invariance of fuzzy TBoxes/ABoxes under bisimilarity (resp. strong bisimilarity), and the Hennessy-Milner property of fuzzy (resp. crisp) bisimulation for fuzzy DLs without (resp. with) involutive negation under the Gödel semantics. Apart from these fundamental results, we also provide results on using fuzzy bisimulation to separate the expressive powers of fuzzy DLs, as well as results on using strong bisimilarity to minimize fuzzy interpretations.",110,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

In which, data representation has been proven to be one of the most influential factors to the model’s performance but still has many limitations. In this work, we take advantage of compressed information in the shortest dependency path (SDP) between two corresponding entities to classify the relation between them. We propose (i) a compositional embedding that combines several dominant linguistic as well as architectural features and (ii) dependency tree normalization techniques for generating rich representations for both words and dependency relations in the SDP.

While the problem of machine comprehension has received multiple success with the help of large training corpora and the emergence of attention mechanism, the development of document retrieval in open-domain QA is lagged behind. In this work, we propose a novel encoding method for learning question-aware self-attentive document representations. By applying pair-wise ranking approach to these encodings, we build a Document Retriever, called QASA, which is then integrated with a machine reader to form a complete open-domain QA system.

That is, there exists a learning algorithm such that, for every concept C of those logics, there exists a training information system such that applying the learning algorithm to it results in a concept equivalent to C. For this result, we introduce universal interpretations and bounded bisimulation in description logics and develop an appropriate learning algorithm.

Fuzzy DLs can be used for such domains when data and knowledge about them are vague. One of the possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In (fuzzy) DLs, it can be used for concept learning. In this paper, for the first time, we define fuzzy bisimulation and (crisp) bisimilarity for fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics. The considered logics are fuzzy extensions of the DL ALCreg with additional features among inverse roles, nominals, qualified number restrictions, the universal role and local reflexivity of a role. We give results on invariance of concepts as well as conditional invariance of TBoxes and ABoxes for bisimilarity in fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics. We also provide a theorem on the Hennessy-Milner property for fuzzy bisimulations in fuzzy DLs under the Gödel semantics",110,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

The proposed clustering algorithm can automatic detects the number of clusters, and it does not need a convergence iteration like traditional ones like K-means.

Getting multi-label examples is costly and time-consuming; therefore, semi-supervised learning approach should be considered to take advantages of both labelled and unlabelled data. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised MLC algorithm exploiting the specific features of the prominent class label(s) chosen by a greedy approach as an extension of the LIFT algorithm, and unlabelled data consumption mechanism from the TExt classification using Semi-supervised Clustering algorithm. We also make a semi-supervised MLC application framework for Vietnamese texts with several feature enrichment steps including (a) a stage of enriching features by adding hidden topic features and (b) a stage of dimensional reduction for subtracting irrelevant features.

In this paper, we propose a CID relation extraction model that learns features automatically through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) instead of traditional handcrafted features. We exploit the shortest dependency path between a disease and a chemical for identifying their CID relation.

In this article, we describe an extension of our system (namely UET-CAM) that participated in the BioCreative V CDR. The original UET-CAM system’s performance was ranked fourth among 18 participating systems by the BioCreative CDR track committee. In the Disease Named Entity Recognition and Normalization (DNER) phase, our system employed joint inference (decoding) with a perceptron-based named entity recognizer (NER) and a back-off model with Semantic Supervised Indexing and Skip-gram for named entity normalization. In the chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction phase, we proposed a pipeline that includes a coreference resolution module and a Support Vector Machine relation extraction model. The former module utilized a multi-pass sieve to extend entity recall. In this article, the UET-CAM system was improved by adding a ‘silver’ CID corpus to train the prediction model. This silver standard corpus of more than 50 thousand sentences was automatically built based on the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) database. We evaluated our method on the CDR test set. Results showed that our system could reach the state of the art performance with F1 of 82.44 for the DNER task and 58.90 for the CID task.

Despite obtaining compelling results in terms of AICc and BIC measurements, the k-means method forms a group of all and only invariant sites that results in bias/wrong phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we improve the k-means algorithm by re-classifying invariant sites into different sub-alignments based on their likelihood values. Experimental results on simulated and empirical DNA datasets showed that the new method, called iK-means, overcame the pitfall of the K-means method, consequently, helps improve the quality of the partitioning sub-alignments. We recommend using the iK-means method to level up the accuracy in inferring phylogenetic trees.",111,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

1655,1940,A protein alignment partitioning method for protein phylogenetic inference.,"Phylogenetic trees inferred from protein sequences are strongly affected by amino acid evolutionary models. Choosing proper models are needed to account for the heterogeneity in evolutionary patterns across sites, especially when analyzing multiple genes or whole genome datasets. Partitioning is a prominent approach to combine sites undergone similar evolutionary processes into separated groups with proper models. The partitioning scheme can be defined by using structural features of the sequences, however, determining structural features of protein sequences is not always practical. Recently, methods have been proposed to automatically cluster sites into groups based on the rates of sites. The rate of sites is a good indicator; however, it is unable to properly reflex the complex evolutionary processes of sites along the protein sequence. In this paper, we present a new algorithm to automatically determine a partitioning scheme based on the best-fit model of sites, i.e., sites belong to the same model will be classified into the same group. Comparing our proposed method with current methods on a set of empirical protein datasets showed that our method helped to build better trees than other methods tested. Our method will significantly improve protein phylogenetic inference from multiple gene or whole genome datasets.",111,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

In this paper, we present MPBoot, a new method for approximating MP bootstrap based on the idea of a previously introduced method for maximum likelihood bootstrap. MPBoot economizes the computations by only sampling trees on the original alignment and simultaneously calculating exact parsimony scores for all bootstrap alignments. Preliminary experiments on simulated data showed that MPBoot is about 2-3.5 times faster and yields better parsimony scores than a fast bootstrap procedure implemented in TNT. MPBoot also produced less biased support value than TNT for small simulated data sets (<;= 200 sequences). However, for large number of sequences (>=500) MPBoot overestimates the probability that a clade is true, i.e., results in likely high false positive rates. As MPBoot is currently a proof-of-concept implementation, more work is to understand the limitations of the method.",111,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

It is therefore naturally questioned whether the standard reference genome can work well for all human genome studies or population-specific reference genomes are needed accordingly. In this paper, we present a pipeline for constructing and evaluating a population-specific reference genome.

Experiments showed that the resulting Vietnamese reference genome was better than the standard reference genome at analyzing Vietnamese genomic data.

Selecting short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can knockdown target genes efficiently is one of the key tasks in studying RNAi. A number of predictive models have been proposed to predict knockdown efficacy of siRNAs, however, their performance is still far from the expectation. This work aims to develop a predictive model to enhance siRNA knockdown efficacy prediction. The key idea is to combine both the rule -- based and the model -- based approaches. To this end, views of siRNAs that integrate available siRNA design rules are first learned using an adaptive Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm. The learned views and other properties of siRNAs are combined to final representations of siRNAs. The elastic net regression method is employed to learn a predictive model from these final representations.

These raw data are processed by computational methods, called genotype caller, to obtain genotypes. Genotype calls of different callers might not be consistent due to noise of bad samples or SNPs. This requires a manual quality control step conducted by experts to remove bad samples or bad SNP sites.

This Web server implements the maximum-likelihood estimation procedure that was used to estimate LG, and provides a number of tools and facilities. Users upload a set of multiple protein alignments from their domain of interest and receive the resulting matrix by email, along with statistics and comparisons with other matrices.

1675,1961,Exploring Efficiency of GAN-based Generated URLs for Phishing URL Detection.,"The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to refer to the resources on the Internet by giving hyperlinks to the websites. Different resources are referenced by different network addresses or different URLs. As a result, embedding malware on websites by using malicious URLs is one of the most dangerous types of cyberattacks today and poses a serious threats to the safety of systems. In order to detect the phishing URLs, the most commonly used approach recently is using deep learning networks with a large number of URL samples, including both malign and benign ones for training the deep networks. However, the available URL databases have a modest number of samples. In addition, the disadvantage of these databases is the imbalance distribution of malicious and non-malicious URL strings. In fact, it is difficult to collect or update malicious URLs because these URLs only exist for a short time, after being detected they are changed again and again. In order to solve this challenge, in this work, we propose to train a GAN network named WGAN-GP for generating malicious URLs from the available phishing URL data. We then integrate the generated phishing URL data into the existing URL database and perform two URL classifiers of LSTM and GRU to give the comparative results. The experiments on different quantities of URL samples show the improvement for URL classification by using WGAN-GP and LSTM classifier.",113,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
1676,1962,Reducing Blocking Artifacts in CNN-Based Image Steganography by Additional Loss Functions.,"Our work improves the encoded image quality from HiDDeN framework, an end-to-end image steganography based on deep convolution neural network. In the encoding phase of HiDDeN framework, to embed a message in a cover image, it is required to split the cover image into smaller image blocks and embed the message bits in each block in parallel. These embedded blocks are then combined to form an encoded image that has the same size as the cover image. This image reconstruction process causes artifacts that appear on the boundaries of the blocks. This can be explained by the fact that when message bits are embedded in the image blocks, the pixel-level information of each image block is unequally alternated. In order to reduce block artifacts, in this work we propose a blocking loss as an additional objective function in HiDDeN framework. This loss measures the difference between encoded images and modified versions of the cover images. The proposed method is evaluated on COCO 2014 and BOSS datasets and the experimental results show the effectiveness in reducing the block artifacts that appeared in the encoded images of HiDDeN framework. This has an important impact on increasing the invisibility or transparency of the steganography system.

In the Non-temporal approach, our model establishes an error observation function in a specific interval of the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi output. It is then able to reduce the positioning error by looking for ways to minimize the error function. The Temporal approach employs an extended error model that takes into account the time component between users’ movements. For performance evaluation, several multi-user scenarios in an indoor environment are set up.

The touch modality is one of the less studied in HRI but could be valuable for naturalistic interaction. However touch signals can vary in semantics. It is therefore necessary to be able to recognize touch gestures in order to make human-robot interaction even more natural. We propose a method to recognize touch gestures.

The VDM defines a taxonomy of dance movement classes and their relationships for the traditional Vietnamese dances taking into account the semantics of its art and its cultural anthropologists. The VDM terminology describes elementary movements (poses) as a dataset ontology importing the ontology VDM. These poses are results of dance sequences segmentation (using segmentation techniques). In this paper, we support the initial ontology VDM by complex classification rules written with SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language, which is the OWL complementary language) to classify non-elementary movements. The objective is to entail classes of movement phrases, which are non-elementary basic movements with complete meaning and illustrated using Mõ dances.

This is especially required when the assertions are provided by multiple and often conflicting sources having different reliability levels. We focus on the so-called egalitarian merging problem which aims to minimize the dissatisfaction degree of each individual source. The question addressed in this paper is how to merge prioritized assertional bases, in a possibility theory framework, when the uncertainty scales are not commensurable, namely when the sources do not share the same meaning of uncertainty scales. Using the notion of compatible scale, we provide a safe way to perform merging. The main result of the paper is that the egalitarian merging of prioritized assertional bases can be achieved in a polynomial time even if the uncertainty scales are not commensurable.",114,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
1688,1975,Single view image based - 3D human pose reconstruction.,"In this paper, we propose an improved framework for estimating 3D human pose sequences from 2D videos. Prior methods were declared to solve this problem; however, they sometimes produced invalid poses because the constraint of result poses was not robust enough to satisfy anthropometric regular body pose. Our goal is to eliminate this drawback, provide more accurate estimated poses. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, we start by generating a set of class-independent body part candidates for each video frame and constructing a fully connected graph from these candidates. Integer linear programming is used to label each candidate by a part class and assign it to individuals to form accurate and consistent pose. We then make the outputs from the first stage suitable for the next stage by inferring the 2D joint configuration. Second, from 2D poses resulted from the first stage, 3D poses are reconstructed by a matching pursuit algorithm operating on camera projection, all the output must adapt the anthropometric regular body pose constraint such as limb length and joint angle constraint. Third, we exploit the temporal and spatial information in videos to obtain more accurate 3D poses. Our experiments on CMU MOCAP dataset show that the proposed framework produces better results compared with prior works.",114,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
1689,1976,Emotional Facial Expression Analysis in the Time Domain.,"Emotions have been studied for a long time and results show that they play an important role in human cognitive functions. In fact, emotions play an extremely important role during the communication between people. And the human face is the most communicative part of the body for expressing emotions; it is recognized that a link exists between facial activity and emotional states. In order to make computer applications more believable and friendly, giving them the ability to recognize and/or express emotions are research fields which have been much focused on. Being able to perform these tasks, firstly, we need to have knowledge about the relationship between emotion and facial activity. Up to now, there have been proposed researches on this relationship. However, almost all these researches focused on analyzing the relationship without taking into account time factors. They analyzed the relationship but did not examined it in the time domain. In this paper, we propose a work on analyzing the relationship between emotions and facial activity in the time domain. Our goal is finding the temporal patterns of facial activity of six basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust). To perform this task, we analyzed a spontaneous video database in order to consider how facial activities which are related to the six basic emotions happen temporally. From there, we bring out the general temporal patterns for facial expressions of each of the six emotions.",114,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

In 3D reconstruction, especially in skull-based 3D facial reconstruction, features usually play an important role. Because, the accuracy in feature detection strongly affects the accuracy of the 3D final model. In this paper, we concentrate on accuracy of 3D reconstructed skull, one important part in skull-based 3D facial reconstruction. We discuss a cause of errors called shift errors when taking sequence of skull images. In addition, we analysis the effect of shift error in 3D reconstruction and propose solution to limit the effect.",114,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
1691,1978,Facial Soft Tissue Thicknesses Prediction Using Anthropometric Distances.,"Predicting the face of an unidentified individual from its skeletal remains is a difficult matter. Obviously, if the soft tissue thicknesses at every location at the skull are known, we can easily rebuild the face from the skull model. Thus, the problem turns out to be predicting the soft tissue thicknesses for any given skull. With the rapid development of the computer, different techniques are being used in the community for prediction tasks and in recent years the concept of neural networks has emerged as one of them. The principal strength of the neural network is its ability to find patterns and irregularities as well as detecting multi-dimensional non-linear connections in data. In this paper, we propose a method of applying neural networks to predict the soft tissue thicknesses for facial reconstruction. We use the distances between anthropometric locations at the skull as input, and the soft tissue thicknesses as output, as this format is suitable for many machine learning mechanisms. These data is collected and measured from candidates using the Computed Tomography (CT) technique.",114,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
1692,1979,3D Facial Reconstruction System from Skull for Vietnamese.,"Reconstructing the 3D facial model of an unidentified individual from his skull contributes considerable benefits to terms of archaeology, anthropology and forensic investigation but it is still significantly complicated matter. Computer aided system of 3D facial reconstruction based on skull has a great advantage of reduction in time consumption. Nevertheless, existing results either contain graphical artifacts or reflect incorrectly differences among reconstructed faces. In this paper, we propose a Vietnamese 3D facial reconstruction system from skull that can overcome existing problems. Machine learning is applied to CT image database of living Vietnamese to learn the relationship between skull measurements and soft tissue thicknesses. Then, the soft tissue thicknesses for each individual are calculated from his/her skull measurements. Moreover, instead of using a fixed number of dowels, extra dowels are added to deform a 3D template face, which ensures the smoothness of the 3D reconstructed face as well as represents best the characteristics of the face to be reconstructed.",114,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data.

1694,1981,MPBoot: fast phylogenetic maximum parsimony tree inference and bootstrap approximation,"The nonparametric bootstrap is widely used to measure the branch support of phylogenetic trees. However, bootstrapping is computationally expensive and remains a bottleneck in phylogenetic analyses. Recently, an ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) approach was proposed for maximum likelihood analyses. However, such an approach is still missing for maximum parsimony. To close this gap we present MPBoot, an adaptation and extension of UFBoot to compute branch supports under the maximum parsimony principle. MPBoot works for both uniform and non-uniform cost matrices. Our analyses on biological DNA and protein showed that under uniform cost matrices, MPBoot runs on average 4.7 (DNA) to 7 times (protein data) (range: 1.2–20.7) faster than the standard parsimony bootstrap implemented in PAUP*; but 1.6 (DNA) to 4.1 times (protein data) slower than the standard bootstrap with a fast search routine in TNT (fast-TNT). However, for non-uniform cost matrices MPBoot is 5 (DNA) to 13 times (protein data) (range:0.3–63.9) faster than fast-TNT. We note that MPBoot achieves better scores more frequently than PAUP* and fast-TNT. However, this effect is less pronounced if an intensive but slower search in TNT is invoked. Moreover, experiments on large-scale simulated data show that while both PAUP* and TNT bootstrap estimates are too conservative, MPBoot bootstrap estimates appear more unbiased. MPBoot provides an efficient alternative to the standard maximum parsimony bootstrap procedure. It shows favorable performance in terms of run time, the capability of finding a maximum parsimony tree, and high bootstrap …",118,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

Citation and download counts are widely available from digital libraries. However, current annotation systems rely on proprietary labels, refer to journals but not articles or authors, and are manually curated. To address these limitations, we propose a social framework based on crowdsourced annotations of scholars, designed to keep up with the rapidly evolving disciplinary and interdisciplinary landscape. We describe a system called Scholarometer, which provides a service to scholars by computing citation-based impact measures. This creates an incentive for users to provide disciplinary annotations of authors, which in turn can be used to compute disciplinary metrics. We first present the system architecture and several heuristics to deal with noisy bibliographic and annotation data. We report on data sharing and interactive visualization services enabled by Scholarometer. Usage statistics, illustrating the data collected and shared through the framework, suggest that the proposed crowdsourcing approach can be successful. Secondly, we illustrate how the disciplinary bibliometric indicators elicited by Scholarometer allow us to implement for the first time a universal impact measure proposed in the literature. Our evaluation suggests that this metric provides an effective means for comparing scholarly impact across disciplinary boundaries.",118,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
1696,1983,Crowdsourcing scholarly data,"One of the promises of Web Science is to leverage the wisdom of the crowds to give rise to emergent, bottom-up semantics, by making it easy for users to express relationships between arbitrary kinds of objects. Rather than starting with an ontology that determines the kinds of objects and relationships to be described and reasoned about, the idea is to give users the freedom to annotate arbitrary objects with arbitrary predicates, along with incentives for such annotations. Social tagging systems for images are one example, where the motivation can stem from the wish to organize and share one’s photos or from entertaining games to guess one another’s tags. Here we explore a similar approach in the domain of scholarly publications. We describe a system called Scholarometer, which provides a service to scholars by computing citation-based impact measures. This motivates users to provide disciplinary annotations for authors, which in turn can be used to compute for the first time measures that allow to compare authors’ impact across disciplinary boundaries. We show how this crowdsourcing approach can lead to emergent semantic networks to study interdisciplinary annotations and trends.",118,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

MPBoot economizes the computations by only sampling trees on the original alignment and simultaneously calculating exact parsimony scores for all bootstrap alignments. Preliminary experiments on simulated data showed that MPBoot is about 2-3.5 times faster and yields better parsimony scores than a fast bootstrap procedure implemented in TNT.

Since the bootstrap trees are not calculated independently, processes must share results throughout task execution.

However, in many real-world situations, problems include a lack of weight information for the times, criteria, and decision-makers (DMs). To remedy such discrepancies, an optimization model has been proposed to determine the weights of attributes, times, and DMs. A new concept related to the correlation measure and some distance measures for the dynamic interval-valued neutrosophic set (DIVNS) are defined in this paper.

1726,2026,Domain-driven design using meta-attributes: a DSL-based approach,"Applying object-oriented domain-driven design in practice requires bridging the gaps that exist among the perceived domain class models of the key stakeholders involved. In this paper, we propose a domain-driven design method that uses meta-attributes with an aim to fill these gaps. Our method extends and generalises a previous work to use meta-attributes to build the domain class model. The meta-attributes are designed to not only make it easier for the designer and domain expert to collaboratively capture the domain-specific requirements in the model, but to ease the translation of the model to design specification. This specification is written in an object-oriented, internal DSL. To increase productivity, we define a generator function that realises the meta-mapping between the state and behaviour spaces of a domain class to automatically generate its behavioural specification. We demonstrate our method …",124,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

This paper proposes an approach based on the integration of Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) and the Object Constraint Language (OCL) in order to explain a behavioral relation between models at different levels of abstraction. Triple rules incorporating OCL allow us to synchronize execution scenarios of a system at two levels. In this way we obtain an integrated operational semantics of the models as well as the possibility for conformance verification between them.

In object oriented domain driven design, a number of high-level patterns have been identified and applied for over a decade. However, no concrete design patterns for domain modeling in this method have been published in the literature. A primary challenge in defining these design patterns is how to express their form in a way that eases their application to a specific domain that uses a specific object oriented programming platform. In this work, we propose a set of concrete design patterns, whose form is expressed in a domain class modeling language (DCML). DCML is based on UML and uses implementation-aware meta-attributes to define design metadata. We extend this language with new meta-attributes to support the proposed design patterns.

Test cases in TCSL can contain detailed information including test steps, test objects within steps, actions of test objects, and test data. Such information is often ignored in currently available test case specifications. We then aim to generate test cases in a TCSL model by a transformation from use cases that are represented by a USL.

A use case model is often represented by a loose combination between a UML use case diagram and a textual description in natural language. The use case model expressed in such a form often contains ambiguous and imprecise parts. This prevents integrating it into model-driven approaches, where use case models are often taken as the source of transformations. This paper introduces a domain specific language named the Use case Specification Language (USL) to precisely specify use cases with two main features:(1) The USL has a concrete syntax in graphical form that allows us to achieve the usability goal;(2) The precise semantics of USL that is defined by mapping the USL to a Labelled Transition System (LTS) opens a possibility for transformations from USL models to other artifacts such as …",124,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

So far existing approaches have often focused on the generation of static models but have omitted the inference of business rules that could complement the static models and improve the precision of the software specification. In this sense this paper provides a first set of invariant inference patterns that are applied on valid and invalid snapshots in order to generate OCL~(Object Constraint Language) integrity constraints that the system should always satisfy.

Consequently, these negotiation approaches are not able to handle the correlation factors among services. This paper presents a flexible correlation-aware negotiation approach for service compositions. In our approach, the service correlations are considered as factors affecting the choice of concrete services.

This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to the variability of failures in SPL systems. These unexpected behaviors are caused by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. Although localizing bugs in non-configurable code has been investigated in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored.

In this paper, we present DeFP, a novel method for ranking static analysis warnings. Based on the intuition that warnings which have similar contexts tend to have similar labels (true positive or false positive), DeFP is built with two BiLSTM models to capture the patterns associated with the contexts of labeled warnings. After that, for a set of new warnings, DeFP can calculate and rank them according to their likelihoods to be true positives (i.e., actual vulnerabilities). Our experimental results on a dataset of 10 real-world projects show that using DeFP, by investigating only 60% of the warnings, developers can find +90% of actual vulnerabilities.

However, current popular bibliometric databases such as Scopus and Web of Science have not addressed this point efficiently. To this end, we propose an approach to revise the authors’ affiliation information of articles in bibliometric databases. We build a model to classify articles to institutions with high accuracy by assembling the bag of words and n-grams techniques for extracting features of affiliation strings. After that, these features are weighted to determine their importance to each institution. Affiliation strings of articles are transformed into the new feature space by integrating weights of features and local characteristics of words and phrases contributing to the sequences. Finally, on the feature space, the support vector classifier method is applied to learn a predictive model.

Prior methods were declared to solve this problem; however, they sometimes produced invalid poses because the constraint of result poses was not robust enough to satisfy anthropometric regular body pose. Our goal is to eliminate this drawback, provide more accurate estimated poses. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, we start by generating a set of class-independent body part candidates for each video frame and constructing a fully connected graph from these candidates. Integer linear programming is used to label each candidate by a part class and assign it to individuals to form accurate and consistent pose. We then make the outputs from the first stage suitable for the next stage by inferring the 2D joint configuration. Second, from 2D poses resulted from the first stage, 3D poses are reconstructed by a matching pursuit algorithm operating on camera projection, all the output must adapt the anthropometric regular body pose constraint such as limb length and joint angle constraint.

1805,2115,AcoSeeD: An Ant Colony Optimization for Finding Optimal Spaced Seeds in Biological Sequence Search.,"Similarity search in biological sequence database is one of the most popular and important bioinformatics tasks. Spaced seeds have been increasingly used to improve the quality and sensitivity of searching, for example, in seeded alignment methods. Finding optimal spaced seeds is a NP-hard problem. In this study we introduce an application of an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to address this problem in a metaheuristics framework. This method, called AcoSeeD, builds optimal spaced seeds in an elegant construction graph that uses the ACO standard framework with a modified pheromone update. Experimental results demonstrate that AcoSeeD brings a significant improvement of sensitivity while demanding the same computational time as other state-of-the-art methods. We also introduces an alternative way of using local search that exerts a fast approximation of the objective function in ACO.",121,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
1806,2116,Use of structural DNA properties for the prediction of transcription-factor binding sites in Escherichia coli.,"Recognition of genomic binding sites by transcription factors can occur through base-specific recognition, or by recognition of variations within the structure of the DNA macromolecule. In this article, we investigate what information can be retrieved from local DNA structural properties that is relevant to transcription factor binding and that cannot be captured by the nucleotide sequence alone. More specifically, we explore the benefit of employing the structural characteristics of DNA to create binding-site models that encompass indirect recognition for the Escherichia coli model organism. We developed a novel methodology [Conditional Random fields of Smoothed Structural Data (CRoSSeD)], based on structural scales and conditional random fields to model and predict regulator binding sites. The value of relying on local structural-DNA properties is demonstrated by improved classifier performance on a large number of biological datasets, and by the detection of novel binding sites which could be validated by independent data sources, and which could not be identified using sequence data alone. We further show that the CRoSSeD-binding-site models can be related to the actual molecular mechanisms of the transcription factor DNA binding, and thus cannot only be used for prediction of novel sites, but might also give valuable insights into unknown binding mechanisms of transcription factors.

1808,2118,Prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites using conditional random fields.,"Phosphorylation is a crucial post-translational protein modification mechanism with important regulatory functions in biological systems. It is catalyzed by a group of enzymes called kinases, each of which recognizes certain target sites in its substrate proteins. Several authors have built computational models trained from sets of experimentally validated phosphorylation sites to predict these target sites for each given kinase. All of these models suffer from certain limitations, such as the fact that they do not take into account the dependencies between amino acid motifs within protein sequences in a global fashion. Results: We propose a novel approach to predict phosphorylation sites from the protein sequence. The method uses a positive dataset to train a conditional random field (CRF) model. The negative training dataset is used to specify the decision threshold corresponding to a desired false positive rate. Application of the method on experimentally verified benchmark phosphorylation data (Phospho.ELM) shows that it performs well compared to existing methods for most kinases.

With no prior knowledge about anchor/clue to match, this becomes a combinatorial problem. Global features of the fingerprints (e.g., singular core and delta points) can be used as the anchor to speed up the matching process. Most approaches use the conventional Poincare Index method with additional techniques to improve the detection of the core and delta points. Our approach uses Convolution Neural Networks which gained state-of-the-art results in many computer vision tasks to automatically detect those points. With the experimental results on FVC2002 database, we achieved the accuracy and false alarm of (96%, 7.5%) and (90%, 6%) for detecting core, and delta points, correspondingly.

Here, we focus on the directed and unweighted relationships among members in a social network. It can then be illustrated as a directed, unweighted graph. Moreover, determining the relationship between any two members is similar to finding the shortest path between two vertices. With such a large-scale dynamic social network, we face the problem of having concurrent operations from adding or removing edges dynamically while one may ask to determine the relationship between two members. To solve this issue, we propose an efficient parallel method based on (i) utilizing an appropriate data structure, (ii) parallelizing the updating actions and (iii) improving the performance of query processing by both reducing the searching space and computing in multi-threaded parallel.

Prior work has a strong focuses on the algorithmic aspect of the problem, and little attention has been paid to the definition of the data structure supporting the implementation of the algorithm. Thus, we present in this paper an efficient algorithm to compute the closeness centrality of all nodes in a social network. Our algorithm is based on (i) an appropriate data structure for increasing the cache hit rate, and then reducing amount of time accessing the main memory for the graph data, and (ii) an efficient and parallel complete BFS search to reduce the execution time. We tested performance of our algorithm, namely BigGraph, with five different real-world social networks and compare the performance to that of current approaches including TeexGraph and NetworKit.

1819,2129,A study of evolutionary multiobjective algorithms and their application to knapsack and nurse scheduling problems,"Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) based on the concept of Pareto dominance seem the most suitable technique for multiobjective optimisation. In multiobjective optimisation, several criteria (usually conflicting) need to be taken into consideration simultaneously to assess a quality of a solution. Instead of finding a single solution, a set of trade-off or compromise solutions that represents a good approximation to the Pareto optimal set is often required. This thesis presents an investigation on evolutionary algorithms within the framework of multiobjective optimisation. This addresses a number of key issues in evolutionary multiobjective optimisation. Also, a new evolutionary multiobjective (EMO) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, this new EMO algorithm is applied to solve the multiple 0/1 knapsack problem (a wellknown benchmark multiobjective combinatorial optimisation problem) producing competitive results when compared to other state-of-the-art MOEAs. Secondly, this thesis also investigates the application of general EMO algorithms to solve real-world nurse scheduling problems. One of the challenges in solving real-world nurse scheduling problems is that these problems are highly constrained and specific-problem heuristics are normally required to handle these constraints. These heuristics have considerable influence on the search which could override the effect that general EMO algorithms could have in the solution process when applied to this type of problems. This thesis outlines a proposal for a general approach to model the nurse scheduling problems without the requirement of problem-specific heuristics so that general EMO algorithms …",132,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
1820,2130,A Method to Ensure Compliance with Attribute and Role Based Access Control Policy for Executing BPMN Models.,"The stringent control of access rights during business processes execution is an important technique to ensure systems security. Business processes are often designed and operated based on models represented by domain-specific languages, such as BPMN. Moreover, access control policies are often studied and specified based on access control models, such as Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC). These security techniques have several challenges that need to be addressed, such as (1) ensuring consistency of RBAC/ABAC policy specifications and (2) ensuring compliance with RBAC/ABAC policies when executing a business process. In this paper, we propose using a metamodeling technique to take advantage of UML and OCL’s expressive power in order to facilitate validation and verification of RBAC/ABAC policies. Within our approach, the RBAC metamodel is extended so that ABAC constraints for complex business rules could be captured and checked. We build a support tool by incorporating Activiti (the support tool for specifying and implementing BPMN models) with USE (UML-based Specification Environment).

1821,2131,Automatic Extraction of Analysis Class Diagrams from Use Cases.,"At the early phase of software development, functional requirements of the software often need to be represented in the developer's language, resulting in a so-called analysis model. Current works in literature aim to increase automation in software development by either generating automatically the analysis model from a use case specification or transforming the analysis model to a design model. However, up to now, to precisely specify use cases is still a challenge, preventing us from realizing this aim. This paper proposes a method to extract analysis classes from a use case specification. Within our method, use cases are represented using our domain-specific modeling language named USL. We then define algorithms with transformation rules as a representation of analysis patterns in order to extract analysis classes from the USL use case model. We develop a support tool for our method in which transformation rules are realized using the ATL model-to-model transformation technique.",124,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

The analysis of rule dependencies from the declarative specification is expected to bring advantages for testing transformation properties.In this paper, we proposed a black-box approach for testing relational model transformations based on the analysis of the declarative specification using Triple Graph Grammar (TGG) rules. We exploit declarative TGG rules to capture the rule dependencies. Then, rule dependencies are combined together using the t-way testing technique to create test case descriptions. We transform patterns representing the input test condition and the oracle function of a test case description into OCL (Object Constraint Language) constraints to facilitate automatically generating input test models by solving constraints and querying interesting properties on the output models.",124,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Although the DDD method prescribes a set of design patterns for the domain model, it provides no languages or tools that realise these patterns. There have been several software frameworks developed to address this gap. However, these frameworks have not tackled two important software construction issues: generative, module-based software construction and development environment integration. In this paper, we propose a framework, named jDomainApp, and an Eclipse IDE plugin to address these issues. In particular, we extend our recent works on DDD to propose a software configuration language that expresses the software configuration, needed to automatically generate software from a set of modules. The modules are automatically generated using a module configuration language that we defined in a previous work. We demonstrate the framework and plug-in using a real-world software example.

This prevents integrating it into model-driven approaches, where use case models are often taken as the source of transformations. In this paper, we introduce a domain-specific language named the Use case Specification Language (USL) to precisely specify use cases. We define the abstract syntax of USL using a metamodel together with OCL wellformedness rules and then provide a graphical concrete syntax for the usability goal. We also define a precise semantics for USL by mapping USL models to Labelled Transition Systems (LTSs). It opens a possibility to transform USL models to software artifacts such as test cases and design models. We focus on a transformation from a USL model to a template-based use case description in order to illustrate our method.

Precision can be achieved by augmenting the models with constraints, and consistency can be achieved by avoiding contradictory constraints. Model finding is a technique to maintain this kind of consistency. It automatically checks the satisfiability of models by using example instances. However, this technique is often inefficient when applied to large models due to the huge search space. In this paper, we propose a technique to narrow the search space by using patterns to represent constraints. Constraint patterns allow us to put further restrictions on the search space.

We represent such a synchronization using a transition system, where a state is viewed as a triple graph presenting the connection of current scenarios, and a transition is defined as a triple graph transformation rule. As a result, the conformance property can be represented as a Computational Tree Logic (CTL) formula and checked by model checkers. We define the transition system using our extension of UML activity diagrams together with Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) incorporating Object Constraint Language (OCL).

In particular, today often only basic RBAC concepts have found their way into commercial RBAC products; specifically, authorization constraints are not widely supported. In this paper, we present an RBAC administration tool that can enforce certain kinds of role-based authorization constraints such as separation of duty constraints.

Our proposed system is designed to be lightweight in computation and very fast in response to the changes of travelers’ vehicle modes or driving events. The vehicle mode detection module is responsible for recognizing both motorized vehicles, such as cars, buses, and motorbikes, and non-motorized ones, for instance, walking, and bikes.

We prove useful properties on the dynamic programming matrix used to compute reconciliations, which allows to speed-up the tree space exploration when rearrangements are generated by Nearest Neighbor Interchanges (NNI) edit operations. Experimental results on simulated and real data confirm that running times are greatly reduced when considering the above-mentioned optimization in comparison to the naïve rearrangement procedure. Results also show that gene trees modified by such NNI rearrangements are closer to the correct (simulated) trees and lead to more correct event predictions on average.

1839,2149,Resolving Inconsistencies in Probabilistic Knowledge Bases by Quantitative Modification.,"Resolving the inconsistency that appears in knowledge bases is an extremely important stage in the process of merging knowledge bases. With probabilistic context, many studies have solved the inconsistency of a probabilistic knowledge base (PKB) with different approaches. However, these previous focus on addressing the problem of restoring consistency in a PKB by employing the principles of maximum entropy or building the consistency restorer with complex creeping functions. We discover that it is really difficult to find the functions that are utilized in the creeping consistency restorers. Therefore, the process of finding these functions may lead to a poor performance. Based on that, we proposed the inconsistency solvers for a PKB, where we consider revising the functions involved in handling the inconsistency in a simpler direction. Two the inconsistency solvers are the equitable deformation inconsistency solver and the amerced deformation inconsistency solver. Corresponding to each solver, an algorithm to solve inconsistencies in a PKB is proposed. Moreover, the cost of each algorithm also are considered and proved.",127,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
1840,2150,The Front-End Readout as an Encoder IC for Magneto-Resistive Linear Scale Sensors.,"This study proposes a front-end readout circuit as an encoder chip for magneto-resistance (MR) linear scales. A typical MR sensor consists of two major parts: one is its base structure, also called the magnetic scale, which is embedded with multiple grid MR electrodes, while another is an “MR reader” stage with magnets inside and moving on the rails of the base. As the stage is in motion, the magnetic interaction between the moving stage and the base causes the variation of the magneto-resistances of the grid electrodes. In this study, a front-end readout IC chip is successfully designed and realized to acquire temporally-varying resistances in electrical signals as the stage is in motions. The acquired signals are in fact sinusoids and co-sinusoids, which are further deciphered by the front-end readout circuit via newly-designed programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The PGA is particularly designed to amplify the signals up to full dynamic ranges and up to 1 MHz. A 12-bit successive approximation register (SAR) ADC for analog-to-digital conversion is designed with linearity performance of ±1 in the least significant bit (LSB) over the input range of 0.5–2.5 V from peak to peak. The chip was fabricated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 0.35-micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology for verification with a chip size of 6.61 mm2, while the power consumption is 56 mW from a 5-V power supply. The measured integral non-linearity (INL) is −0.79–0.95 LSB while the differential non-linearity (DNL) is −0.68–0.72 LSB. The effective number of bits (ENOB) of the designed ADC is validated as 10.86 for converting the input analog signal to digital counterparts. Experimental validation was conducted. A digital decoder is orchestrated to decipher the harmonic outputs from the ADC via interpolation to the position of the moving stage. It was found that the displacement measurement error is within ±15 µm for a measuring range of 10 mm.",127,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

Subse- quently, private information is a compelling explanation for the frequent occurrence of negotiation breakdowns or costly delays. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for improving efficiency of negotiation outcome for multilateral negotiations with incomplete information (i.e., negotiators holding private information). This objective is achieved by introducing biased distribution of the resulting surplus created by the negotiators’ joint offers to prevent negotiators from misrepresenting their valuations of the negotiation outcomes. Our mechanism is based on rewarding concession-making agents with larger shares of the obtainable surplus.We show that the probabilities that the agents with private information make concession are accordingly increased. This allows for better efficiency to be achieved.",127,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

1845,2155,Improving Diversity and Quality of Adversarial Examples in Adversarial Transformation Network,"This paper proposes a method to mitigate two major issues of Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATN) including the low diversity and the low quality of adversarial examples. In order to deal with the first issue, this research proposes a stacked convolutional autoencoder based on pattern to generalize ATN. This proposed autoencoder could support different patterns such as all-feature pattern, border feature pattern, and class model map pattern. In order to deal with the second issue, this paper presents an algorithm to improve the quality of adversarial examples in terms of L0-norm and L2-norm. This algorithm employs an adversarial feature ranking heuristics such as JSMA and COI to prioritize adversarial features. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the first issue, the proposed autoencoder can generate diverse adversarial examples with the average success rate above 99%. For the second issue, the proposed algorithm could not only improve the quality of adversarial examples significantly but also maintain the average success rate. In terms of L0-norm, the proposed algorithm could decrease from hundreds of adversarial features to one adversarial feature. In terms of L2-norm, the proposed algorithm could reduce the average distance considerably. These results show that the proposed method is capable of generating high-quality and diverse adversarial examples in practice.",132,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

We also demonstrate the rates of convergence for our algorithm under various structural assumptions of the stochastic function: O (1/\sqrtt) for convex functions and O (\log t/t) for strongly convex functions.

1873,2185,Correlation-Sensitive Next-Basket Recommendation,"Items adopted by a user over time are indicative of the underlying preferences. We are concerned with learning such preferences from observed sequences of adoptions for recommendation. As multiple items are commonly adopted concurrently, e.g., a basket of grocery items or a sitting of media consumption, we deal with a sequence of baskets as input, and seek to recommend the next basket. Intuitively, a basket tends to contain groups of related items that support particular needs. Instead of recommending items independently for the next basket, we hypothesize that incorporating information on pairwise correlations among items would help to arrive at more coherent basket recommendations. Towards this objective, we develop a hierarchical network architecture codenamed Beacon to model basket sequences. Each basket is encoded taking into account the relative importance of items and correlations among item pairs. This encoding is utilized to infer sequential associations along the basket sequence. Extensive experiments on three public real-life datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach for the next-basket recommendation problem.",140,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method 
1874,2186,Basket-Sensitive Personalized Item Recommendation,"Personalized item recommendation is useful in narrowing down the list of options provided to a user. In this paper, we address the problem scenario where the user is currently holding a basket of items, and the task is to recommend an item to be added to the basket. Here, we assume that items currently in a basket share some association based on an underlying latent need, eg, ingredients to prepare some dish, spare parts of some device. Thus, it is important that a recommended item is relevant not only to the user, but also to the existing items in the basket. Towards this goal, we propose two approaches. First, we explore a factorization-based model called BFM that incorporates various types of associations involving the user, the target item to be recommended, and the items currently in the basket. Second, based on our observation that various recommendations towards constructing the same basket should have similar likelihoods, we propose another model called CBFM that further incorporates basket-level constraints. Experiments on three real-life datasets from different domains empirically validate these models against baselines based on matrix factorization and association rules.",140,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method 
1875,2187,Modeling Sequential Preferences with Dynamic User and Context Factors,"Users express their preferences for items in diverse forms, through their liking for items, as well as through the sequence in which they consume items. The latter, referred to as “sequential preference”, manifests itself in scenarios such as song or video playlists, topics one reads or writes about in social media, etc. The current approach to modeling sequential preferences relies primarily on the sequence information, i.e., which item follows another item. However, there are other important factors, due to either the user or the context, which may dynamically affect the way a sequence unfolds. In this work, we develop generative modeling of sequences, incorporating dynamic user-biased emission and context-biased transition for sequential preference. Experiments on publicly-available real-life datasets as well as synthetic data show significant improvements in accuracy at predicting the next item in a sequence.",140,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

Given a sequence of a particular type (eg, purchases)--referred to as the target sequence, we seek to predict the next item expected to appear beyond this sequence. This task is known as next-item recommendation. We hypothesize two means for improvement. First, within each time step, a user may interact with multiple items (a basket), with potential latent associations among them. Second, predicting the next item in the target sequence may be helped by also learning from another supporting sequence (eg, clicks). We develop three twin network structures modeling the generation of both target and support basket sequences. One based on"" Siamese networks"" facilitates full sharing of parameters between the two sequence types. The other two based on"" fraternal networks"" facilitate partial sharing of parameters.

However, the involved data selection process may fundamentally suffer from evidence ambiguity and concept drift issues, thereby possibly leading to deleterious effects on the performance of various models. This paper proposes a new Reinforced Data Sampling (RDS) method to learn how to sample data adequately on the search for useful models and insights. We formulate the optimisation problem of model diversification  in data sampling to maximise learning potentials and optimum allocation by injecting model diversity. This work advocates the employment of diverse base learners as value functions such as neural networks, decision trees, or logistic regressions to reinforce the selection process of data subsets with multi-modal belief. We introduce different ensemble reward mechanisms, including soft voting and stochastic choice to approximate optimal sampling policy. The evaluation conducted on four datasets evidently highlights the benefits of using RDS method over traditional sampling approaches. Our experimental results suggest that the trainable sampling for model diversification is useful for competition organisers, researchers, or even starters to pursue full potentials of various machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.

Motivated by the fact that reviews might contain personal information and sentiment bias, we propose a novel differentially private (dp)-embedding model for training privacy guaranteed embeddings and an evaluation approach for sentiment fairness in the food-review domain. Experiments on our novel review dataset show that MG-PriFair is capable of generating plausibly long reviews while controlling the amount of exploited user data and using the least sentiment biased word embeddings.

Any progress will support knowledge discovery and linkage to other resources. However because of their wide variation a number of challenges still remain in terms of their identification and semantic normalisation before they can be fully exploited for research purposes. This paper presents novel techniques for identifying potential complex phenotype mentions by exploiting a hybrid model based on machine learning, rules and dictionary matching. A systematic study is made of how to combine sequence labels from these modules as well as the merits of various ontological resources. We evaluated our approach on a subset of Medline abstracts cited by the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database related to auto-immune diseases. Using partial matching the best micro-averaged F-score for phenotypes and five other entity classes was 79.9%. A best performance of 75.3% was achieved for phenotype candidates using all semantics resources. We observed the advantage of using SVM-based learn-to-rank for sequence label combination over maximum entropy and a priority list approach. The results indicate that the identification of simple entity types such as chemicals and genes are robustly supported by single semantic resources, whereas phenotypes require combinations. Altogether we conclude that our approach coped well with the compositional structure of phenotypes in the auto-immune domain.",142,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

We measure their effect on f-score performance against an in domain baseline. Stacking and feature augmentation mitigate f-score loss but do not necessarily result in superior performance except for selected classes.

Any progress will support knowledge discovery and linkage to other resources. However because of their wide variation a number of challenges still remain in terms of their identification and semantic normalisation before they can be fully exploited for research purposes. This paper presents novel techniques for identifying potential complex phenotype mentions by exploiting a hybrid model based on machine learning, rules and dictionary matching. A systematic study is made of how to combine sequence labels from these modules as well as the merits of various ontological resources. We evaluated our approach on a subset of Medline abstracts cited by the Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man database related to auto-immune diseases. Using partial matching the best micro-averaged F-score for phenotypes and five other entity classes was 79.9%. A best performance of 75.3% was achieved for phenotype candidates using all semantics resources. We observed the advantage of using SVM-based learn-to-rank for sequence label combination over maximum entropy and a priority list approach. The results indicate that the identification of simple entity types such as chemicals and genes are robustly supported by single semantic resources, whereas phenotypes require combinations.

In this paper, we present DeFP, a novel method for ranking static analysis warnings. Based on the intuition that warnings which have similar contexts tend to have similar labels (true positive or false positive), DeFP is built with two BiLSTM models to capture the patterns associated with the contexts of labeled warnings. After that, for a set of new warnings, DeFP can calculate and rank them according to their likelihoods to be true positives (i.e., actual vulnerabilities). Our experimental results on a dataset of 10 real-world projects show that using DeFP, by investigating only 60% of the warnings, developers can find +90% of actual vulnerabilities.

Methods HIV-1 infected adults from three outpatient clinics in Hanoi (Vietnam) were enrolled into the study between 1 March and 13 April 2017. VL was measured on DBS using the optimized protocol provided by the manufacturer and compared to plasma VL as reference method on the Abbott m2000rt RealTime HIV-1 platform. Sensitivity was defined as the ability for DBS samples to correctly identify VL failure at the threshold of 1000 copies/mL of plasma, while specificity represented the ability to identify patients with a plasma HIV-RNA VL of <1000 copies/mL.   Results A total of 203 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 152 (75%) were male. Median age was 38 [inter quartile range: 34–43] years.

A common difficulty encountered in motion tracking is the corrupted data is caused by detachment of markers in 3D motion data or occlusion in 2D tracking data. Most methods for missing markers problem may quickly become ineffective when gaps exist in the trajectories of multiple markers for an extended duration. In this paper, we propose the principal component eigenspace based gap filling methods that leverage a training sample set for estimation. The proposed method is especially beneficial in the scenario of motion data with less predictable or repeated movement patterns, and that of even missing entire frames within an interval of a sequence.

1987,2324,Domain-independent Intent Extraction from Online Texts.,"Identifying user’s intents from texts on online channels has a wide range of applications from entrepreneurship, banking to e-commerce. However, intent identification is not a simple task due to the intent and its attributes are various and strongly depend on the domain of data. If the number of intent domains increases, the number of intent’s attributes will get bigger. As a result, the complexity of intent extraction task grows up significantly. Additionally, when a new domain comes, it involves considerable physical efforts to define specific labels for intent and attributes for that domain. Hence, it would be much better to come up with a new method for extracting user’s intents which is not dependent on a specific domain. In our research, we study the problem of domain-independent intent identification from posts and comments crawled from social networks and discussion forums. We present ten general labels, i.e. labels do not depend on a specific domain, and utilize them when extracting intent and its related information. We also propose a map between general labels and domain-specific labels. We extensively conduct experiments to explore the efficiency of using general labels compared to specific labels in extracting user’s intents when the number of intent domains increases. Our study is conducted on a medium-sized dataset from three selected domains: Tourism, Real Estate and Transportation. In term of accuracy, when the number of domains grows, our proposal achieves significantly better results than domain-specific method in identifying user’s intent.

1988,2325,Integrating Word Embeddings into IBM Word Alignment Models.,"Word alignment models are used to generate word-aligned parallel text which is used in statistical machine translation systems. Currently, the most popular word alignment models are IBM models which have been widely applied in a large number of translation systems. The parameters of IBM models are estimated by using Maximum Likelihood principle, i.e. by counting the co-occurrence of words in the parallel text. This way of parameter estimation leads to the “ambiguity” problem when some words stand together in many sentence pairs but each of them is not translation of any other. Additionally, this method requires large amount of training data to achieve good results. However, parallel text which is used to train the IBM models is usually limited for low-resource languages. In this work, we try to solve these two problems by adding semantic information to the models. Our semantic information is derived from word embeddings which only need monolingual data to train. We deploy evaluation on a language pair that has great differences in grammar structure, English-Vietnamese. Even with this challenged task, our proposed models gain significant improvements in word alignment result and help increasing translation quality.",133,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Technically, the paradigm of anytime-anywhere connectivity raises previously unthinkable challenges, including the management of million of mobile customers, their profiles, the profiles-based selective information dissemination, and server-side computing infrastructure design issues to support such a large pool of users automatically and intelligently. In this paper, we propose a data mining technique for discovering frequent behavioral patterns from a collection of trajectories gathered by Global Positioning System. Although the search space for spatiotemporal knowledge is extremely challenging, imposing spatial and temporal constraints on spatiotemporal sequences makes the computation feasible. Specifically, the mined patterns are incorporated with synthetic constraints, namely spatiotemporal sequence length restriction, minimum and maximum timing gap between events, time window of occurrence of the whole pattern, inclusion or exclusion event constraints, and frequent movement patterns predictive of one ore more classes. The algorithm for mining all frequent constrained patterns is named cAllMOP. Moreover, to control the density of pattern regions a clustering algorithm is exploited. The proposed method is efficient and scalable. Its efficiency is better than that of the previous algorithms AllMOP and GSP with respect to the compactness of discovered knowledge, execution time, and memory requirement.",136,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Apart from the support of timely and desired services and enhanced automation, the technique helps overcome some existing issues such as network flooding due to the massive tracking of users, the latencies of the positioning systems in providing and information delivery.

Many studies have been conducted focusing on the processing of continuous queries in an approximate form. However, this approach is difficult to apply to environmental applications which require the correct data to be stored. In this paper, we propose a weather monitoring system for handling and storing the sensor data stream in real-time in order to support continuous spatial and/or temporal queries. In our system, we exploit two time-based insertion methods to store the sensor data stream and reduce the number of managed tuples, without losing any of the raw data which are useful for queries, by using the sensors’ temporal attributes. In addition, we offer a method for reducing the cost of the join operations used in processing spatiotemporal queries by filtering out a list of irrelevant sensors from query range before making a join operation. In the results of the performance evaluation, the number of tuples obtained from the data stream is reduced by about 30% in comparison to a naïve approach, thereby decreasing the query execution time.",136,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
1994,2331,Online discovery of Heart Rate Variability patterns in mobile healthcare services.,"Recent years, advances in day-to-day wearable sensors have led to the development of low powered physiological sensor platforms, which can be integrated in body area networks, a new enabling technology for real-time health monitoring. The bottleneck in health state awareness is the algorithm that has to interpret the sensor data. Nowadays Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is still the leading cause of death. Many classification techniques such as decision tree and neural networks proposed for an early detection of individual at risk for CHD are not able to continuously detect heart state based on sensor data stream. In this study, we propose an online three-layer neural network to recognize Heart Rate Variability (HRV) patterns related to CHD risk in consideration of daily activities. ECG sensor data is preprocessed using Poincaré plot encoding. Incremental learning is utilized to train the network with new data without forgetting the previously learned patterns. The algorithm is named Poincaré-based HRV patterns discovering Incremental Artificial neural Network (PHIAN). When a sample is presented, the nodes in the hidden layer of PHIAN compete for determining the node with the highest similarity to the input. Error variables associated with the neuron units are used as criteria for new node insertion in hopes of allowing the network to learn new patterns and reducing classification error. However, the node insertion has to be stopped in the overlapping decision areas. We suppose that the overlaps between classes have lower probability than the centric part of the classes. Therefore, after a period of learning we remove the nodes with no neighbor. Plus, the error probability density is taken into account instead of input probability density. Finally, the predictive capability of PHIAN is compared with three previous classification models, namely Self-Organizing Map (SOM), Growing Neural Gas (GNG), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in terms of classification error and network structure. The results show that PHIAN outperforms the existing techniques.

Current LBSs use information about current locations of users to provide services, such as nearest features of interest, they request. Although the common computing strategy in LBSs benefits the users, there are additional benefits when future locations are predicted. One major advantage of location prediction is that it provides LBSs with extended resources, mainly time, to improve system reliability which in turn increases the users’ confidence and the demand for LBSs. In this study, we propose a movement Rule-based Location Prediction method (RLP), to guess the user’s future location for LBSs. Its performance is assessed with respect to precision and recall. In comparison with the previous technique, the prediction accuracy of ours is higher. With the proposed approach, we give an efficient support to the LBSs provider in monitoring user intelligently and sending information to user in a push-driven fashion. Apart from the support of timely and desired services and enhanced automation, the technique helps overcome some existing issues such as network flooding due to the massive tracking of users, the latencies of the positioning systems in providing and information delivery.

In this paper, we present low-error estimation models, which can be useful for fast and accurate determinations of the maximum SAR of a multi-antenna mobile handsets. Fundamentals of the estimation models, built from physical and mathematical perspectives, are first presented and analyzed. For validating the effectiveness of the models, we conduct several SAR measurements for a simple two-antenna mobile handset prototype.

Detailed discussions on the K-order model and the estimation technique will be presented. We also conduct several measurements to verify the performance of the proposed estimation technique, and compare the effectiveness the proposed technique with conventional techniques. As a result, it is confirmed that the proposed technique with K-order estimations can considerably reduce the estimation errors, and thus giving highly precise estimated SAR values.

However, attaching detection models to every single attribute leads to high memory and time complexities, which make attribute-specific models less practical. To remove these barriers, a simple yet effective solution has been proposed. In more details, by exploiting the language function of characters, character distribution can be reduced in size and rearranged in an intentional manner so that both time and memory complexities are reduced significantly. Detection models that use minimized and rearranged character distribution are, therefore, highly efficient and practical, especially suitable to large, high-traffic web applications.",138,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

2005,2342,Hybrid contention-based geographie routing in wireless sensor networks.,"Beaconless and contention-based geographic routing is an attractive approach to resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. Aggressive contention is the most cost-efficient form of contention-based geographic routing since it uses no control packet. Nevertheless, to avoid duplicated data packets, aggressive contention must set restriction on the contention area. Consequently, its packet delivery rate is limited. On the other hand, non-aggressive contention maximizes packet delivery rate by making use of full contention area. As the compensation, control packets have to be used and additional delay is introduced. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Contention-Based Geographic Routing (HCGR) - a protocol that takes full aggressive contention and uses non-aggressive contention for recovering aggressive contention from failure. If aggressive contention succeeds, nonaggressive contention is suppressed. In cases where aggressive contention fails, non-aggressive contention is taken place to deliver data packets. Thus, HCGR can maximize packet delivery rate while keeping its overheads reasonably low.

2011,2348,Power Save Protocol Using Chain Based Routing.,"Sensor networks are deployed in numerous military and civil applications, such as remote target detection, weather monitoring, weather forecast, natural resource exploration and disaster management. Despite having many potential applications, wireless sensor networks still face a number of challenges due to their particular characteristics that other wireless networks, like cellular networks or mobile ad hoc networks do not have. The most difficult challenge of the design of wireless sensor networks is the limited energy resource of the battery of the sensors. This limited resource restricts the operational time that wireless sensor networks can function in their applications. Routing protocols play a major part in the energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks because data communication dissipates most of the energy resource of the networks. In many situations, a base station only needs a summary of the gathered information. For example, the base station might only require the maximum temperature of all sub-regions, each covered by a sensor or the average temperature of all sensors in the network. For similar types of application, data aggregation can be applied at all sensor nodes before the data is forwarded to the base station. The above discussions imply a new family of protocols called chain-based protocols. In the protocols, all sensor nodes sense and gather data in an energy efficient manner by cooperating with their closest neighbors.

Antimalware software can help safeguard information systems and minimize their exposure to the malware. Most of anti-malware programs detect malware instances based on signature or pattern matching. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to automatically detect models and patterns behind different types of malware variants. However, traditional machine-based learning techniques such as SVM, decision trees and naive Bayes seem to be only suitable for detecting malicious code, not effective enough for complex problems such as classification. In this article, we propose a new prototype extraction method for non-traditional prototype-based machine learning classification. The prototypes are extracted using hypercuboids. Each hypercuboid covers all training data points of a malware family. Then we choose the data points nearest to the hyperplanes as the prototypes. Malware samples will be classified based on the distances to the prototypes. Experiments results show that our proposition leads to F1 score of 96.5% for classification of known malware and 97.7% for classification of unknown malware, both better than the original prototype-based classification method.",139,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

Our method is constructed from multiple one-class SVM classifiers and has the ability to classify known malware with F1-Score over 98% and probability to detect unknown malware up to 97%. Unknown malware instances with similar behaviors can also be grouped together so new classes of malware will be discovered.",139,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach 
2014,2351,A Way to Estimate TCP Throughput under Low-Rate DDoS Attacks: One TCP Flow.,"TCP-targeted low-rate distributed denial-of-service (LDDoS) attacks were first introduced by A. Kuzmanovic and E. Knightly in 2003. The authors also proposed a simple model to quantify TCP throughput under LDDoS attacks. Since then, there have been many researchers attemping to estimate the throughput, such as Luo et al. We agree with them upon the sketch of TCP congestion window under a successful LDDoS attack but we find out that there are more cases than what has been specified. Moreover, the relative error of Luo's estimation method is still high. Our goal in this paper is to propose a simple but more accurate method to estimate TCP throughput of a single TCP flow under such DDoS attacks. Our estimation values in various scenarios are compared with the results of simulations performed with NS-2 simulator, so that the effectiveness of our method is illustrated.",139,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

CPR-based approach has been proposed by Zhang et al. to detect and filter this kind of DDoS attacks, but its performance in terms of TCP throughput under attack is shown to be limited by the way it calculates CPR for each flow. In this paper, we will propose some modifications to the CPR-based approach in order to increase its performance.

Among various proposed solutions, we are particularly interested in the Congestion Participation Rate (CPR) metric and the CPR-based approach. Through a simulation study, we show that the existing algorithm cannot simultaneously achieve high TCP throughput while under attack and good fairness performance for new legitimate TCP flows in normal times. We then propose a new version of the CPR-based approach to overcome the tradeoff. Simulation results show that it preserves TCP throughput while under attack fairly well, yet maintains fairness for new TCP flows in normal times.",139,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

However, one of the main drawbacks of the PUMA protocol is that the core of the mesh remains fixed during the whole execution process. In this paper, we present an improvement of PUMA by introducing to it an adaptive core selection mechanism.

2018,2355,Hybrid contention-based geographie routing in wireless sensor networks.,"Beaconless and contention-based geographic routing is an attractive approach to resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. Aggressive contention is the most cost-efficient form of contention-based geographic routing since it uses no control packet. Nevertheless, to avoid duplicated data packets, aggressive contention must set restriction on the contention area. Consequently, its packet delivery rate is limited. On the other hand, non-aggressive contention maximizes packet delivery rate by making use of full contention area. As the compensation, control packets have to be used and additional delay is introduced. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Contention-Based Geographic Routing (HCGR) - a protocol that takes full aggressive contention and uses non-aggressive contention for recovering aggressive contention from failure. If aggressive contention succeeds, nonaggressive contention is suppressed. In cases where aggressive contention fails, non-aggressive contention is taken place to deliver data packets. Thus, HCGR can maximize packet delivery rate while keeping its overheads reasonably low. We implement HCGR and single-form protocols in the network simulator ns-2, conduct extensive simulations and present simulation results.",139,7,based using model vietnamese data system algorithm search mobile problem optimization recognition routing networks analysis

Efficient data retrieval in peer-to-peer networks in general and in Freenet in particular is a challenging problem. We follow the approach of using the small-world behavior to model the data cache replacement in Freenet and propose an extension to it: an adaptive clustering cache replacement scheme instead of LRU and enhanced-clustering cache replacement. The chosen seed key is not fixed but may vary depending on the request change in order to increase the adaptability of Freenet. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves the performance of Freenet better in terms of higher request hit ratio and lower average hops per request in comparison to the two mentioned schemes at heavy workload.,139,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

We address the fundamental problem of how to maximize life-time of the network by using only local information while preserving network connectivity. We start by introducing the Care-Free Sleep (CS) Theorem that provides provably optimal necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to turn off its radio while ensuring that global connectivity is not affected.The CS theorem is the basis for an efficient localized algorithm that decides which node will turn its radio off, and for how long.

2022,2359,Randomized Mobile Agent Based Routing in Wireless Networks.,"We propose a novel approach for shortest path routing in wireless mobile networks. The approach makes use of n mobile agents initially launched from n mobile nodes forming the network. The agents move randomly from node to node and update routing information as they go. The approach is presented in this paper with two protocols. Both of them exhibit good performance in terms of the network and computing resource consumptions. The first protocol relies on independent mobile agents and imposes a minimum bandwidth requirement on individual mobile agents. Each agent carries the link state of its creator and this information remains unchanged except when the mobile agent returns to the home node. The second protocol is a refinement of the first protocol, with some form of interaction between the mobile agents. Each agent maintains the routing table of its creator instead of link state. The randomly walking agents spread the update information and compute the shortest paths via exchanging network state information between the routing tables they carry and the routing tables at the nodes they traverse. The correctness of the protocols is proven. Our analysis shows that the agent cooperation improves the system performance when dealing with topology and link cost changes.",139,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

The randomized moving strategy exerts a negligible and balanced impact on the network resources, both in terms of bandwidth and computation. The memory requirement is very moderate. The correctness of the protocol is proven and its complexity is analyzed.",139,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

In this work, we show the problem of vanishing prior knowledge in streaming variational Bayes. This is a serious drawback in various applications. We then develop a simple framework to boost the external prior when learning a Bayesian model from data streams. By boosting, the prior knowledge can be maintained and efficiently exploited through each minibatch of streaming data. We evaluate the performance of our framework in four scenarios: streaming in synthetic data, streaming sentiment analysis, streaming learning for latent Dirichlet allocation, and streaming text classification, in comparison with the methods that do not keep priors.

It is first proposed to employ the hierarchical sliding mode control approach to design a control law, which guarantees stability and anti-swing of the vehicle when it is driven on a predefined trajectory. More importantly, the unknown and uncertain parameters of the system caused by its actuator nonlinearity and external disturbances are adaptively estimated and inferred by the proposed fuzzy logic mechanism, which results in the efficient operation of the SIMO under-actuated system in real time.

2055,2392,An Autoencoder-based Method for Targeted Attack on Deep Neural Network Models.,"This paper presents an autoencoder-based method for a targeted attack on deep neural network models, named AE4DNN. The proposed method aims to improve the existing targeted attacks in terms of their generalization, transferability, and the trade-off between the quality of adversarial examples and the computational cost. The idea of AE4DNN is that an autoencoder model is trained from a balanced subset of the training set. The trained autoencoder model is then used to generate adversarial examples from the remaining subset of the training set, produce adversarial examples from new samples, and attack other DNN models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of AE4DNN, the compared methods are box-constrained L-BFGS, Carlini-Wagner ‖L‖ 2 attack, and AAE. The comprehensive experiment on MNIST has shown that AE4DNN can gain a better transferability, improve generalization, and generate high quality of adversarial examples while requiring a low cost of computation. This initial result demonstrates the potential ability of AE4DNN in practice, which would help to reduce the effort of testing deep neural network models.",143,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
2056,2393,Efficient AutoML via Combinational Sampling.,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) aims to automatically produce the best machine learning pipeline, i.e., a sequence of operators and their optimized hyperparameter settings, to maximize the performance of an arbitrary machine learning problem. Typically, AutoML based Bayesian optimization (BO) approaches convert the AutoML optimization problem into a Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) problem, where the choice of algorithms is modeled as an additional categorical hyperparameter. In this way, algorithms and their local hyperparameters are referred to as the same level. Consequently, this approach makes the resulting initial sampling less robust. In this study, we describe a first attempt to formulate the AutoML optimization problem as its nature instead of transfer it into a HPO problem. To take advantage of this paradigm, we propose a novel initial sampling approach to maximize the coverage of the AutoML search space to help BO construct a robust surrogate model. We experiment with 2 independent scenarios of AutoML with 2 operators and 6 operators over 117 benchmark datasets. Results of our experiments demonstrate that the performance of BO significantly improved by using our sampling approach.",143,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Natural images are roughly piece-wise smooth signals -- also called cartoon-like images -- and tend to be sparse in the wavelet domain. CartoonX is the first explanation method to exploit this by requiring its explanations to be sparse in the wavelet domain, thus extracting the {relevant piece-wise smooth} part of an image instead of relevant pixel-sparse regions. We demonstrate that CartoonX can reveal novel valuable explanatory information, particularly for misclassifications. Moreover, we show that CartoonX achieves a lower distortion with fewer coefficients than other state-of-the-art methods",143,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

This problem can be formulated as predicting labels (i.e. side effects) for each pair of nodes in a DDI graph, of which nodes are drugs and edges are interacting drugs with known labels. State-of-the-art methods for this problem are graph neural networks (GNNs), which leverage neighborhood information in the graph to learn node representations. For DDI, however, there are many labels with complicated relationships due to the nature of side effects. Usual GNNs often fix labels as one-hot vectors that do not reflect label relationships and potentially do not obtain the highest performance in the difficult cases of infrequent labels. In this paper, we formulate DDI as a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a triple: two nodes for drugs and one node for a label. We then present CentSmoothie, a hypergraph neural network that learns representations of nodes and labels altogether with a novel central-smoothing formulation. We empirically demonstrate the performance advantages of CentSmoothie in simulations as well as real datasets.",143,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

2061,2398,Coastal Wetland Classification with Deep U-Net Convolutional Networks and Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study at the Tien Yen Estuary of Vietnam.,"The natural wetland areas in Vietnam, which are transition areas from inland and ocean, play a crucial role in minimizing coastal hazards; however, during the last two decades, about 64% of these areas have been converted from the natural wetland to the human-made wetland. It is anticipated that the conversion rate continues to increase due to economic development and urbanization. Therefore, monitoring and assessment of the wetland are essential for the coastal vulnerability assessment and geo-ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to propose and verify a new deep learning approach to interpret 9 of 19 coastal wetland types classified in the RAMSAR and MONRE systems for the Tien Yen estuary of Vietnam. Herein, a Resnet framework was integrated into the U-Net to optimize the performance of the proposed deep learning model. The Sentinel-2, ALOS-DEM, and NOAA-DEM satellite images were used as the input data, whereas the output is the predefined nine wetland types. As a result, two ResU-Net models using Adam and RMSprop optimizer functions show the accuracy higher than 85%, especially in forested intertidal wetlands, aquaculture ponds, and farm ponds. The better performance of these models was proved, compared to Random Forest and Support Vector Machine methods. After optimizing the ResU-Net models, they were also used to map the coastal wetland areas correctly in the northeastern part of Vietnam. The final model can potentially update new wetland types in the southern parts and islands in Vietnam towards wetland change monitoring in real time.

This paper empirically investigates the practicality of major dimensionality reduction techniques for encapsulating the high dimensional design space into compact representations. Such low dimensional representations of the design space can be utilized for constructing the surrogate models efficiently. Based on historical mainstays and recent developments in deep learning, we study four dimensionality reduction techniques in this paper, namely Principal Component Analysis, Kernel Principal Component Analysis, Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders. We evaluate and compare these techniques based on quality assessments of the corresponding low dimensional surrogate models on a diverse range of test cases. These test cases are defined on combinations of three dimensionsalities, ten well-known benchmark problems from the continuous optimization domain and two surrogate modeling techniques, namely Kriging and Polynomials. Our results clearly demonstrate the superiority of Autoencoders and Principal Component Analysis on the criteria of modeling accuracy and global optimality respectively.",143,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

In addition, the paper extends the test data compilation mechanism in DART, which currently only supports the projects written in C, to generate test data for C++ projects. The main idea of SDART is when it is less likely to increase code coverage with the current path selection strategies, the static test data generation will be applied with the expectation that more branches are covered earlier. Furthermore, in order to extend the test data compilation of DART for C++ context, the paper suggests a general test driver technique for C++ which supports various types of parameters including basic types, arrays, pointers, and derived types. Currently, an experimental tool has been implemented based on the proposal in order to demonstrate its efficacy in practice. The results have shown that SDART achieves higher branch coverage with a fewer number of test data in comparison with that of DART in practice.",143,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach 
2064,2401,Measuring Ground Subsidence in Ha Noi Through the Radar Interferometry Technique Using TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed Data.,"Multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) is a widely used technique to measure the ground subsidence and has already shown its ability to map such phenomena on a large spatial scale with millimetric accuracy from space. In Vietnam, to have independent SAR data for surface risk applications, a new X-band SAR mission (JV-LOTUSat) has been scheduled for launch for the 2019-2020 timeframe. However, Vietnam is located in tropical regions where their conditions are impacted by strong atmosphere. The aim of this article is to provide a better understanding of the capabilities of the X-band for estimating the ground subsidence under tropical atmospheric conditions. Analysis is carried out on two stacks, TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed X-band, from 2011 to 2014 in Ha Noi. We show that the results on the ground subsidence from InSAR processing can describe consistently the subsidence area based on ground measurements. This article demonstrates that the InSAR technique can be effective at detecting and estimating the subsidence phenomena even with the X-band and under conditions typical of tropical regions. The displacement results from TerraSAR-X and Cosmos SkyMed datasets are consistent, with a correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of 0.91 for the period during which their coverage overlaps. Groundwater overexploitation is one of the main causes of the ground subsidence in Ha Noi. This study provides strong support for the scientific potential of the X-band SAR space-borne mission in Vietnam and other tropical countries because it demonstrates the feasibility of the ground subsidence estimates by the X-band SAR, even in conditions impacted by strong atmosphere.",143,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

Both classification algorithms and resampling techniques involve some hyperparameters that can be tuned. This paper sets up several experiments and draws the conclusion that, compared to using default hyperparameters, applying hyperparameter optimisation for both classification algorithms and resampling approaches can produce the best results for classifying the imbalanced datasets. Moreover, this paper shows that data complexity, especially the overlap between classes, has a big impact on the potential improvement that can be achieved through hyperparameter optimisation. Results of our experiments also indicate that using resampling techniques cannot improve the performance for some complex datasets, which further emphasizes the importance of analyzing data complexity before dealing with imbalanced datasets.",143,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

Our proposed features are combined with periodicity and similarity features to solve false walking problem. The proposed method shows a significant improvement of 99.42% and 96.47% of the average of accuracy in free walking and false walking problems, respectively, on our datasets. Furthermore, our proposed method also achieves the average accuracy of 97.04% on public datasets and better accuracy in comparison with three commercial step counting applications: Pedometer and Weight Loss Coach installed on Lenovo P780, Health apps in iPhone 5s (iOS 10.3.3), and S-health in Samsung Galaxy S5 (Android 6.01).

2067,2404,Behavior-based video recommendation using adaptive neuro-fuzzy system on social TV.,"User-based collaborative filtering often considers a set of users who rated on a target item and computes similarities between other users and the target user to select his/her neighbors, then extrapolates the target user’s rating from the neighbors’ ratings. This traditional approach uses only the neighbors’ ratings for recommendation measurement. However, according to our study, dissimilar users whose ratings still significantly influence to the target user’s rating prediction. In addition, to choose a video to watch, a user often takes in to consideration multi criteria. We analyze users’ behavior to choose a video. They often explore genres or tags, then read abstraction before choosing a video to watch. Therefore, their ratings and the information of a video have a strong correlation. Therefore, based on the fuzzy neural network, a new collaborative filtering method for video recommendation is proposed. Here, the fuzzy neural network is used to learn users’ ratings with respect to their behaviors. The proposal here is to adjust a model of the neural network with input is users’ behavior and output is their ratings for each target video. Concretely, the behavior of a user (or user profile) is learned by the users’ ratings and the information of the corresponding videos. In addition, for each target video, all users’ profile who made ratings on it will be collected. Then each profile is treated as an input of the fuzzy neural network and the corresponding rating value is treated as output of the fuzzy neural network. The rating of a user on the target video will be predicted based on the trained neural network.

They propose to construct verifiable aspects which are automatically generated from OCL constraints. These aspects can be woven into Java code to check whether object invariants are violated at runtime. Benefiting from AOP in separation of crosscutting concerns and weaving mechanisms, generated aspects can do the verification task whenever values of objects' attributes are changed.

2076,2413,Web Search Clustering and Labeling with Hidden Topics.,"Web search clustering is a solution to reorganize search results (also called “snippets”) in a more convenient way for browsing. There are three key requirements for such post-retrieval clustering systems: (1) the clustering algorithm should group similar documents together; (2) clusters should be labeled with descriptive phrases; and (3) the clustering system should provide high-quality clustering without downloading the whole Web page. This article introduces a novel framework for clustering Web search results in Vietnamese which targets the three above issues. The main motivation is that by enriching short snippets with hidden topics from huge resources of documents on the Internet, it is able to cluster and label such snippets effectively in a topic-oriented manner without concerning whole Web pages. Our approach is based on recent successful topic analysis models, such as Probabilistic-Latent Semantic Analysis, or Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The underlying idea of the framework is that we collect a very large external data collection called “universal dataset,” and then build a clustering system on both the original snippets and a rich set of hidden topics discovered from the universal data collection. This can be seen as a richer representation of snippets to be clustered. We carry out careful evaluation of our method and show that our method can yield impressive clustering quality.",157,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

Unsupervised models focus on extracting keyphrases based only on the information contained in that document without interacting with other documents. While a good performance supervised learning model for keyphrase generation requires a massive effort to build training data, which can not generalize to new domains. Moreover, according to human perception, a user would comprehend the topic expressed in a document better if that user has already read other documents that express the same topic. Based on the above idea, we proposed a collaborative keyphrase generation system (CollabKG): a novel semi-supervised method by leveraging limited labeled data. The amount of labeled data will be enriched over time by the user. In our work, we conduct research on a large scale dataset consisting of 500,000 Vietnamese administrative documents. In CollabKG, each document is represented as a feature vector, and a cluster pruning algorithm is employed to accelerate finding the most similar documents. The generated keyphrases were manually evaluated for relevance and accuracy. In the final, the result we achieved shows high ratification.

Database manipulation using natural language, therefore, is much more convenient since any normal user can interact with their data without a background of database and SQL.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase approach to automatically analyzing and converting natural language queries into the corresponding SQL forms. In our approach, the first phase is component segmentation which identifies primary clauses in SQL such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, etc. The second phase is slot- filling that helps extract sub-components for each primary clause such as SELECT column(s), SELECT aggregation operation, etc. We carefully conducted an empirical evaluation for our method using conditional random fields (CRFs) on a medium-sized corpus of natural language queries in Vietnamese, and have achieved promising results with an average accuracy of more than 90%.",160,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning

This is the first assessment of the Global Land Cover by National Mapping Organizations (GLCNMO) version 2 method for producing global urban map in 2008. An improved and optimized algorithm is then developed based on the GLCNMO method for Vietnam taking into account of local natural and social conditions. Improving method is then applied to produce urban maps of Vietnam for the years of 2008 and 2015. Accuracy assessment showed that the improved method can achieve up to 13% higher precision and 10% higher F1 measure as compared to the global GNCNMO method. Also, an increasing trend was observed in population density in urban area in the period from 2008 to 2015 in Vietnam which may correspond to fast urbanization process in the country.

Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks have shown promising results by modeling the information diffusion process in graphs. It provides a unified framework for graph embedding that can leverage both the social graph structure and node features information. In this paper, we improve the embedding output of the graph-based convolution layer by adding a number of transformer layers.

2086,2423,Exploring Efficiency of GAN-based Generated URLs for Phishing URL Detection.,"The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is used to refer to the resources on the Internet by giving hyperlinks to the websites. Different resources are referenced by different network addresses or different URLs. As a result, embedding malware on websites by using malicious URLs is one of the most dangerous types of cyberattacks today and poses a serious threats to the safety of systems. In order to detect the phishing URLs, the most commonly used approach recently is using deep learning networks with a large number of URL samples, including both malign and benign ones for training the deep networks. However, the available URL databases have a modest number of samples. In addition, the disadvantage of these databases is the imbalance distribution of malicious and non-malicious URL strings. In fact, it is difficult to collect or update malicious URLs because these URLs only exist for a short time, after being detected they are changed again and again. In order to solve this challenge, in this work, we propose to train a GAN network named WGAN-GP for generating malicious URLs from the available phishing URL data. We then integrate the generated phishing URL data into the existing URL database and perform two URL classifiers of LSTM and GRU to give the comparative results. The experiments on different quantities of URL samples show the improvement for URL classification by using WGAN-GP and LSTM classifier.",165,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
2087,2424,Reducing Blocking Artifacts in CNN-Based Image Steganography by Additional Loss Functions.,"Our work improves the encoded image quality from HiDDeN framework, an end-to-end image steganography based on deep convolution neural network. In the encoding phase of HiDDeN framework, to embed a message in a cover image, it is required to split the cover image into smaller image blocks and embed the message bits in each block in parallel. These embedded blocks are then combined to form an encoded image that has the same size as the cover image. This image reconstruction process causes artifacts that appear on the boundaries of the blocks. This can be explained by the fact that when message bits are embedded in the image blocks, the pixel-level information of each image block is unequally alternated. In order to reduce block artifacts, in this work we propose a blocking loss as an additional objective function in HiDDeN framework. This loss measures the difference between encoded images and modified versions of the cover images. The proposed method is evaluated on COCO 2014 and BOSS datasets and the experimental results show the effectiveness in reducing the block artifacts that appeared in the encoded images of HiDDeN framework. This has an important impact on increasing the invisibility or transparency of the steganography system. In addition, the experimental result on secrecy of the proposed method also indicates the same performance as the HiDDeN pipeline.",165,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

2092,2431,Improving Diversity and Quality of Adversarial Examples in Adversarial Transformation Network,"This paper proposes a method to mitigate two major issues of Adversarial Transformation Networks (ATN) including the low diversity and the low quality of adversarial examples. In order to deal with the first issue, this research proposes a stacked convolutional autoencoder based on pattern to generalize ATN. This proposed autoencoder could support different patterns such as all-feature pattern, border feature pattern, and class model map pattern. In order to deal with the second issue, this paper presents an algorithm to improve the quality of adversarial examples in terms of L0-norm and L2-norm. This algorithm employs an adversarial feature ranking heuristics such as JSMA and COI to prioritize adversarial features. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the first issue, the proposed autoencoder can generate diverse adversarial examples with the average success rate above 99%. For the second issue, the proposed algorithm could not only improve the quality of adversarial examples significantly but also maintain the average success rate. In terms of L0-norm, the proposed algorithm could decrease from hundreds of adversarial features to one adversarial feature. In terms of L2-norm, the proposed algorithm could reduce the average distance considerably.

However, these adversarial examples might contain many redundant perturbations. Removing these perturbations increases the quality of adversarial examples. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to improve the quality of adversarial examples by recognizing and then removing such perturbations. The proposed method includes two phases namely the autoencoder training phase and the improvement phase. In the autoencoder training phase, the proposed method trains an autoencoder that learns how to recognize redundant perturbations. In the second phase, the proposed method uses the trained autoencoder in combination with the greedy improvement step to produce more high-quality adversarial examples. The experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 have shown that the proposed method could improve the quality of adversarial examples significantly. In terms of L0-norm, the distance decreases by about 82%-95%. In terms of L2-norm, the distance drops by around 56%-81%. Additionally, the proposed method has a low computational cost.

The F-Sandbox is a new type for IoT sandbox, automatically created from the real firmware of the specialized IoT devices, inheriting the specialized environment in the real firmware, therefore creating a diverse environment for sandboxing as an important characteristic of IoT sandbox.

To ascertain if the two populations represent a cosmopolitan species or a species complex, we used a series of morphological, morphometric and molecular phylogenetic analyses on European and Asian material of L. corrugatus. We further investigated the phylogenetic context of the genus Liocarcinus with related portunid taxa to establish its monophyly. Liocarcinus is paraphyletic with respect to Polybius henslowii. We propose that P. henslowii is a valid species, most likely the result of a very recent speciation within L. holsatus. The first gonopods of Asian and European L. corrugatus are similar in shape, but the carapaces of the Asian specimens are significantly longer. While L. corrugatus is monophyletic, the European and Asian populations separate into two distinct clades with high support. Based on the consistent morphological difference and the deep genetic differentiation (p-distance of 4.5% for COX1), the European and Asian populations of L. corrugatus should be treated as two distinct species.

2117,2459,AXI-NoC: High-Performance Adaptation Unit for ARM Processors in Network-on-Chip Architectures,"The increasing demand on scalability and reusability of system-on-chip design as well as the decoupling between computation and communication has motivated the growth of the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm in the last decade. In NoC-based systems, the computational resources (ie IPs) communicate with each other using a network infrastructure. Many works have focused on the development of NoC architectures and routing mechanisms, while the interfacing between network and associated IPs also needs to be considered. In this paper, we present a novel efficient AXI (AMBA eXtensible Interface) compliant network adapter for NoC architectures, which is named an AXI-NoC adapter. The proposed network adapter achieves high communication throughput of 20.8 Gbits/s and consumes 4.14 mW at the operating frequency of 650 MHz. It has a low area footprint (952 gates, approximate to 2, 793 µm2 with CMOS 45 nm technology) thanks to its effective hybrid micro-architectures and with zero latency thanks to the proposed mux-selection method.",193,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2118,2460,Reducing temporal redundancy in MJPEG using Zipfian estimation techniques,"Motion JPEG simply compresses each frame in a video sequence using JPEG still image compression standard. This video codec satisfies power consumption and real-time properties of embedded systems while having very low complexity. However, the downside is its inefficiency in reducing the bit-rate because there are still redundancies between encoded frames. In this paper, we focus on reducing temporal redundancies in MJPEG using a motion detection algorithm, called Zipfian estimation. The Zipfian estimation helps MJPEG extract separately the moving blocks and the stationary blocks then removes temporal redundancies by minimizing encoded bit-stream of stationary blocks and encoding only the residuals of the moving blocks between adjacent frames. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide twice compression ratio as much as the conventional MJPEG, and an approximate …",193,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

2122,2464,An Overview of H. 264 Hardware Encoder Architectures Including Low-Power Features,"H.264 is the most popular video coding standard with high potent coding performance. For its efficiency, the H.264 is expected to encode real-time and/or high-definition video. However, the H.264 standard also requires highly complex and long lasting computation. To overcome these difficulties, many efforts have been deployed to increase encoding speed. Besides, with the revolution of portable devices, multimedia chips for mobile environments are more and more developed. Thus, power-oriented design for H.264 video encoders is currently a tremendous challenge. This paper discusses these trends and presents an overview of the state of the art on power features for different H.264 hardware encoding architectures. We also propose the VENGME's design, a particular hardware architecture of H.264 encoder that enables applying low-power techniques and developing power-aware ability. This low power encoder is a four-stage architecture with memory access reduction, in which, each module has been optimized.

2123,2465,Reducing Bitrate and Increasing the Quality of Inter Frame by Avoiding Quantization Errors in Stationary Blocks,"In image compression and video coding, quantization error helps to reduce the amount of information of the high frequency components. However, in temporal prediction the quantization error contributes its value as noise in the total residual information. Therefore, the residual signal of the inter-picture prediction is greater than the expected one and always differs zero value even input video contains only homogeneous frames. In this paper, we reveal negative effects of quantization errors in inter prediction and propose a video encoding scheme which is able to avoid side effects of quantization errors in the stationary parts. We propose to implement a motion detection algorithm as the first stage of video encoding to separate the video into two parts: motion and static. The motion information allows us to force residual data of non-changed part to zero and keep the residual signal of motion regularly. Beside, we design block-based filters which improve motion results and filter those results fit into block encode size well. Fixed residual data of static information permits us to pre-calculate its quantized coefficient and create a bypass encoding path for it. Experimental results with the JPEG compression (MJPEG-DPCM) showed that the proposed method produces lower bitrate than the conventional MJPEG-DPCM at the same quantization parameter and a lower computational complexity.",193,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path 
2124,2466,An innovative lightweight cryptography system for Internet-of-Things ULP applications,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has been fostered by accelerated advancements in communication technologies, computation technologies,sensor technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and semiconductor technologies. In general, IoT contains cloud computing to do data processing, communication infrastructure including the Internet, and sensor nodes which can collect data, send them through the network infrastructure to the Internet, and receive controls to react to the environment. During its operations, IoT may collect, transmit and process secret data, which raise security problems. Implementing security mechanisms for IoT is challenging because IoT organizations include millions of devices integrated at multiple layers, whereas each layer has different computation capabilities and security requirements. Furthermore, sensor nodes in IoT are intended to be battery-based constrained devices with limited power budget, limited computation, and limited memory footprint to reduce costs. Implementing security mechanisms on these devices even encounters more challenges. This work is therefore motivated to focus on implementing data encryption to protect IoT sensor nodes and systems with the consideration of hardware cost, throughput and power/energy consumption. To begin with, a ultra-low-power block cipher crypto-accelerator with configurable parameters is proposed and implemented in ST 28nm FDSOI technology in SNACk test chip with two cryptography modules: AES and PRESENT.

To this end, we propose an approach to revise the authors’ affiliation information of articles in bibliometric databases. We build a model to classify articles to institutions with high accuracy by assembling the bag of words and n-grams techniques for extracting features of affiliation strings. After that, these features are weighted to determine their importance to each institution. Affiliation strings of articles are transformed into the new feature space by integrating weights of features and local characteristics of words and phrases contributing to the sequences.

The assessment tools include 1) a geographical information system database, which describes physical, socio-economic, and environmental conditions; 2) spatial multi-criteria decision analysis, and 3) evaluating criteria by a pair-wise comparison method. Consequently, coastal vulnerability criteria were determined following three periods of a year with different density of migrating birds: the highest density period–from September to March of the following year; the average density period–April and from August to October; the lowest density period–the remaining time in year. For each period, 5 levels of vulnerability (from 1-lowest to 5-highest level) were determined. High vulnerability level is concentrated in a great area, belonging to the ecological restored area and the south of communes Giao Thien, Giao Xuan; Low vulnerability level is distributed in communes of the buffer zone.

However, these approaches also reveal some disadvantages of the system, such as taking a longer time for generating association rules; applying the Apriori algorithm on rating sparse matrix resulting in irrelevant information and causing poor recommendation results to target users and association rules generated primarily relying on given threshold of Support and Confidence measures leading to the focus on the majority of rules and ignoring the astonishment of rules to affect the recommendation results. In this study, we propose a new model for collaborative filtering recommender systems: The collaborative recommendation is based on statistical implication rules (IIR); Differently from collaborative recommendation based on association rules (AR), the IIR predicts the items for users based on statistical implication rules generated from rating matrix and Implication intensity measures measuring the surprisingness of rules.

However, disadvantages of biodiesel such as high viscosity and high density affected diesel engines and fuel systems negatively. Thus, it is necessary to reduce the viscosity and density of biodiesel fuel in unmodified diesel engines. Until now, a large number of empirical correlations have been used to predict the viscosity and density of biodiesel–fossil diesel fuel blend This study was conducted to predict the kinematic viscosity and density of blends of biodiesel and fossil diesel fuel. Three types of biodiesel were examined: Coconut oil-based biodiesel (COB), Jatropha oil-based biodiesel (JOB), and Waste oil-based biodiesel (WOB). Twenty-four samples of the three types of biodiesel–diesel fuel blends were created by blending 5%(B5), 10%(B10), 20%(B20), 40%(B40), 50%(B50), 60%(B60), 75%(B75), and 100%(B100) of biodiesel with conventional diesel fuel to produce the corresponding blends for experimental purposes. Experimental correlations and mathematical equations for predicting the relationship between the kinematic viscosity and the density of the biodiesel–fossil diesel fuel blends, the dependence of the kinematic viscosity and the density of the biodiesel–fossil diesel fuel blends on biodiesel fractions, and the effects of temperature on the kinematic viscosity and density of pure biodiesel were developed.

Since estimating F0 from glottalized waveform is rather problematic for usual F0 extractors, we propose a pitch marking algorithm where pitch marks are propagated from regular regions of a speech signal to glottalized ones, from which complete F0 contours for the glottalized tones are derived. The proposed F0 parameterization scheme was confirmed to significantly reduce the hoarseness whilst slightly improving the tone naturalness of synthetic speech by both objective and listening tests. The pitch marking algorithm works as a refinement step based on the results of an F0 extractor. Therefore, the proposed scheme can be combined with any F0 extractor.",232,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

2301,2701,A generation error function considering dynamic properties of speech parameters for minimum generation error training for hidden Markov model-based speech synthesis,"A minimum generation error (MGE) criterion has been proposed for model training in hidden Markov model (HMM)-based speech synthesis to minimize the error between generated and original static parameter sequences of speech. However, dynamic properties of speech parameters are ignored in the generation error definition. In this study, we incorporate these dynamic properties into MGE training by introducing the error component of dynamic features (ie, delta and delta-delta parameters) into the generation error function. We propose two methods for setting the weight associated with the additional error component. In the fixed weighting approach, this weight is kept constant over the course of speech. In the adaptive weighting approach, it is adjusted according to the degree of dynamicity of speech segments. An objective evaluation shows that the newly derived MGE criterion with the adaptive weighting method results in comparable performance for the static feature and better performance for the delta feature compared with the baseline MGE criterion. Subjective listening tests exhibit a small but statistically significant improvement in the quality of speech synthesized by the proposed technique. The newly derived criterion improves the capability of HMMs in capturing dynamic properties of speech without increasing the computational complexity of the training process compared with the baseline criterion.",232,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

With their potential benefits, they have been the topic of a great deal of research over the last decade. To exploit the partial reconfiguration capability of FPGAs, there is a need for efficient, dynamically adaptive communication infrastructure that automatically adapts as modules are added to and removed from the system. Many bus and network-on-chip (NoC) architectures have been proposed to exploit this capability on FPGA technology. However, few realizations have been reported in the public literature to demonstrate or compare their performance in real world applications. While partial reconfiguration can offer many benefits, it is still rarely exploited in practical applications. Few full realizations of partially reconfigurable systems in current FPGA technologies have been published. More application experiments are required to understand the benefits and limitations of implementing partially reconfigurable systems and to guide their further development. The motivation of this thesis is to fill this research gap by providing empirical evidence of the cost and benefits of different interconnect architectures.

Detecting anomalies in human walking, such as shuffling gait, stiff leg or unsteady gait, can be difficult if the prior knowledge of such a gait pattern is not available. We propose an approach for detecting abnormal human gait based on a normal gait model. Instead of employing the color image, silhouette, or spatio-temporal volume, our model is created based on human joint positions (skeleton) in time series. We decompose each sequence of normal gait images into gait cycles. Each human instant posture is represented by a feature vector which describes relationships between pairs of bone joints located in the lower body. Such vectors are then converted into codewords using a clustering technique. The normal human gait model is created based on multiple sequences of codewords corresponding to different gait cycles. In the detection stage, a gait cycle with normality likelihood below a threshold, which is determined automatically in the training step, is assumed as an anomaly. The experimental results on both marker-based mocap data and Kinect skeleton show that our method is very promising in distinguishing normal and abnormal gaits with an overall accuracy of 90.12%.",235,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

Mirrors are employed as virtual depth cameras placed at different positions. All measured depth data are provided in only one frame at each time. Significant depth distortion behind a mirror, which occurred with a standard time-of-flight depth sensor, is reduced by removing unreliable points and/or re-estimating better positions for these points.

The use of straight bio-oils for diesel engines entails improving their disadvantages such as high density, high surface tension and kinematic viscosity (tri-physical parameters). There have been some as-used methods for reduction of the above-mentioned negative effects related to straight bio-oil disadvantage, however, the adequately-heating method may be considered as a simple one helping the physical parameters of straight bio-oils to reach stable and highly-confident values which are close to those of traditional diesel fuel. As a consequence, the spray and atomization, combustion, performance, and emissions of diesel engines fueled with preheated bio-oils are improved.

In the ordinary data acquisition process, the dataset was selected randomly from a large pool of unlabeled images for labeling, leading to massive labor time to annotate those images. Besides that, hand-designed model development is strenuous and also costly. This paper introduces a pipeline that relies on Active Learning to ease the labeling work and utilizes Neural Architecture Search's idea to design the adequate deep learning model automatically.

In this research, we introduce a new approach with efficient cost and easy setup to collecting head pose images, namely UET-Headpose dataset, with top-view head pose data. This method uses an absolute orientation sensor instead of Depth cameras to be set up quickly and small cost but still ensure good results.

According to many state-of-the-art methods, the pipeline of this task consists of two parts, from face detection to head pose estimation. These two steps are completely independent and do not share information. This makes the model clear in setup but does not leverage most of the featured resources extracted in each model. In this paper, we proposed the Multitask-Net model with the motivation to leverage the features extracted from the face detection model, sharing them with the head pose estimation branch to improve accuracy. Also, with the variety of data, the Euler angle domain representing the face is large, our model can predict with results in the 360° Euler angle domain. Applying the multitask learning method, the Multitask-Net model can simultaneously predict the position and direction of the human head. To increase the ability to predict the head direction of the model, we change the representation of the human face from the Euler angle to vectors of the Rotation matrix.",184,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2467,3000,Prosodic Boundary Prediction Model for Vietnamese Text-To-Speech.,"This research aims to build a prosodic boundary prediction model for improving the naturalness of Vietnamese speech synthesis. This model can be used directly to predict prosodic boundaries in the synthesis phase of the statistical parametric or end-to-end speech systems. Beside conventional features related to Part-Of-Speech (POS), this paper proposes two efficient features to predict prosodic boundaries: syntactic blocks and syntactic links, based on a thorough analysis of a Vietnamese dataset. Syntactic blocks are syntactic phrases whose sizes are bounded in their constituent syntactic tree. A syntactic link of two adjacent words is calculated based on the distance between them in the syntax tree. The experimental results show that the two proposed predictors improve the quality of the boundary prediction model using a decision tree classification algorithm, about 36.4% (F1 score) higher than the model with only POS features. The final boundary prediction model with POS, syntactic block, and syntactic link features using the LightGBM algorithm gives the best F1-score results at 87.0% in test data. The proposed model helps the TTS systems, developed by either HMM-based, DNN-based, or End-to-end speech synthesis techniques, improve about 0.3 MOS points (i.e. 6 to 10%) compared to the ones without the proposed model.",190,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
2468,3001,A Hypercuboid-Based Machine Learning Algorithm for Malware Classification.,"Malware attacks have been among the most serious threats to cyber security in the last decade. Antimalware software can help safeguard information systems and minimize their exposure to the malware. Most of anti-malware programs detect malware instances based on signature or pattern matching. Data mining and machine learning techniques can be used to automatically detect models and patterns behind different types of malware variants. However, traditional machine-based learning techniques such as SVM, decision trees and naive Bayes seem to be only suitable for detecting malicious code, not effective enough for complex problems such as classification. In this article, we propose a new prototype extraction method for non-traditional prototype-based machine learning classification. The prototypes are extracted using hypercuboids. Each hypercuboid covers all training data points of a malware family. Then we choose the data points nearest to the hyperplanes as the prototypes. Malware samples will be classified based on the distances to the prototypes. Experiments results show that our proposition leads to F1 score of 96.5% for classification of known malware and 97.7% for classification of unknown malware, both better than the original prototype-based classification method.",190,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

We used the novel extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBR) technique together with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for feature selection to construct and verify a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 105 sampling plots conducted in November and December of 2018 and incorporated the dual polarimetric (HH and HV) data of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and the Sentinel-2 multispectral data combined with Sentinel-1 (C-band VV and VH) data. We employed the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The capability of the XGBR-GA model was assessed via a comparison with other machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e., the CatBoost regression (CBR), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) models. The XGBR-GA model yielded a promising result (R2 = 0.683, RMSE = 25.08 Mg·ha−1) and outperformed the four other ML models. The XGBR-GA model retrieved a mangrove AGB ranging from 17 Mg·ha−1 to 142 Mg·ha−1 (with an average of 72.47 Mg·ha−1). Therefore, multisource optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) combined with the XGBR-GA model can be used to estimate the mangrove AGB in North Vietnam.

2470,3005,Intonation issues in HMM-based speech synthesis for Vietnamese.,"In an HMM-based Text-To-Speech system, contextual features, including phonetic and prosodic factors have a significant influence to the spectrum, F0 and duration of the synthetic voice. This paper proposes prosodic features aiming at improving the naturalness of an HMM-based TTS system (VTed) for a tonal language, Vietnamese. The ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) features are used to learn two crucial prosodic cues i.e. intonation (boundary tones) and pause (break indices), concurrently with another set of features. The result of MOS test showed that the general quality of synthetic voice is rather good, 1.21 point lower than the natural voice. About 55% of the voice trained with ToBI boundary tone feature are perceived as similar to the voice trained without this feature, while a 10% difference in favour of the voice trained without this ToBI feature is observed. This may be linked with F0 contour lowering or raising regardless of lexical tones. This brought two main problems in the synthetic voice: discontinuity in spectrum and F0 or unexpected voice quality. This paper then concluded the need of much more work on intonation modeling that should take into account the Vietnamese tones. A new prosody model can be designed, which may consider the ToBI model, with respect to lexical tones and the syntactic structure of Vietnamese.",190,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

We have built a brand new ITS called WinITS with our proposed responsive student model and deployed it in Hanoi National University of Education-Vietnam (HNUE) in the second semester of the school year 2019-2020 with a computer science course. To compare the effectiveness of applying ITS to the students, we compare test results and analyze some other aspects related to the course. On the other hand, we conducted a survey between two groups: with and without using WinITS. 63 students are volunteers who participated in the case study. Before learning, 43 students from Group 1 will take a short survey of the Felder-Silverman questionnaire to identify learning styles, after that, they go through all the lessons from the course under the support of WinITS, the lessons will be chosen to satisfy student’s need. On another side, 18 students from Group 2 will make the same test to compare the result to Group 1. In the range of research, we illustrate that our implementation shows some encouraging results such as reducing learning time, improving test score by 1.13 standard deviations, and making the lesson more interesting and flexible. The results have revealed some advantages of studying with computer-added compared to the traditional class in various ways and showed the effectiveness of the proposed model in Intelligent Tutoring Systems.",193,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
2472,3008,A deep wavelet sparse autoencoder method for online and automatic electrooculographical artifact removal.,"Electrooculographical (EOG) artifacts are problematic to electroencephalographical (EEG) signal analysis and degrade performance of brain–computer interfaces. A novel, robust deep wavelet sparse autoencoder (DWSAE) method is presented and validated for fully automated EOG artifact removal. DWSAE takes advantage of wavelet transform and sparse autoencoder to become a universal EOG artifact corrector. After being trained without supervision, the sparse autoencoder performs EOG correction on time–frequency coefficients collected after brain wave signal wavelet decomposition. Corrected coefficients are then used for wavelet reconstruction of uncontaminated EEG signals. DWSAE is compared with five other methods: second-order blind identification, information maximization, joint approximation diagonalization of eigen-matrices, wavelet neural network (WNN) and wavelet thresholding (WT). Experimental results on a visual attention task dataset, a mental state recognition dataset and a semi-simulated contaminated EEG dataset show that DWSAE is capable of suppressing EOG artifacts effectively, while preserving the nature of background EEG signals. The mean square error of signals before and after correction by DWSAE on a semi-simulated contaminated EEG segment of 30 s is the lowest (65.62) when compared to the results produced by WNN and WT. DWSAE addresses limitations posed by these methods in three ways. First, DWSAE can be performed automatically and online in a single channel of EEG data; this has advantages over independent component analysis-based methods. Second, its results are robust and stable in comparison with those of other wavelet-based methods. Third, as an unsupervised learning scheme, DWSAE does not require the off-line training that is necessary for WNN and other supervised learning machine learning-based methods.",193,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

Although there have been many studies on the classification of speech, the results are still limited. Firstly, most of the speech classification approaches requiring input data have the same dimension. Secondly, all traditional methods must be trained before classifying speech signal and must be retrained when having more training data or new class. In this paper, we propose an approach for speech classification using Scale-invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features on spectrogram images of speech signal combination with Local naïve Bayes nearest neighbor. The proposed approach allows using feature vectors to have different sizes. With this approach, the achieved classification results are satisfactory. They are 73, 96, 95, 97 %, and 97 % on the ISOLET, English Isolated Digits, Vietnamese Places, Vietnamese Digits, JVPD databases, respectively. Especially, in a subset of the TMW database, the accuracy is 100 %. In addition, in our proposed approach, non-retraining is needed for additional training data after the training phase.

Although, there have been many studies on the classification of speech signals, the results are still limited on both accuracy and the size of the vocabulary. When classifying a huge volumes vocabulary, the speech classification becomes more and more difficult. Today, there are some frameworks that allow working with big data. One of these is a data mining utility. It can perform supervised classification procedures on very large amounts of data, usually named as big data, on a distributed infrastructure by using the MapReduce framework of Hadoop clusters. This tool has four classification approaches implemented. These are Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines (SVM). All these approaches require input data having the same size, so the input data must be quantized before using. This leads to decrease the accuracy in the classification stage.

FAMs possess important advantages including noise tolerance, unlimited storage, and one pass convergence. An important property, deciding FAM performance, is the ability to capture content of each pattern, and association of patterns. Existing FAMs capture either content or association of patterns well, but not both of them. They are designed to handle either erosive or dilative noise in distorted inputs but not both. Therefore, they cannot recall distorted input patterns very well when both erosive and dilative noises are present. In this paper, we propose a new FAM called content-association associative memory (ACAM) that stores both content and association of patterns. The weight matrix is formed with the weighted sum of output pattern and the difference between input and output patterns.

By introducing video analysis and computer vision techniques, it is possible to build a spatio-temporal representation of the investigation. Such a representation gives a better overview than a set of photos and makes an investigation more accessible. We develop such methods and present an interface for navigating the result. The processing includes (i) segmenting a log into events using novel structure and motion features making the log easier to access in the time dimension, and (ii) mapping video frames to a 3D model of the scene so the log can be navigated in space. Our results show that, using our proposed features, we can recognize more than 70 percent of all frames correctly, and more importantly find all the events. From there we provide a method to semi-interactively map those events to a 3D model of the scene. With this we can map more than 80 percent of the events.

Our face can represent lip movements during emotionally pronouncing Vietnamese words, and at the same time it can show emotional facial expressions while speaking. The face's architecture consists of three parts: Vietnamese Emotional Speech Synthesis module, Emotions to Facial Expressions module, and Combination module which creates lip movements when pronouncing Vietnamese emotional speech and combines these movements with emotional facial expressions. We have tested the face in the football supporter domain in order to confirm its naturalness. The face is simulated as the face of a football supporter agent which experiences emotions and expresses emotional expressions in his voice as well as on his face.",193,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2483,3019,A technique for extracting behavioral sequence patterns from GPS recorded data.,"The mobile wireless market has been attracting many customers. Technically, the paradigm of anytime-anywhere connectivity raises previously unthinkable challenges, including the management of million of mobile customers, their profiles, the profiles-based selective information dissemination, and server-side computing infrastructure design issues to support such a large pool of users automatically and intelligently. In this paper, we propose a data mining technique for discovering frequent behavioral patterns from a collection of trajectories gathered by Global Positioning System. Although the search space for spatiotemporal knowledge is extremely challenging, imposing spatial and temporal constraints on spatiotemporal sequences makes the computation feasible. Specifically, the mined patterns are incorporated with synthetic constraints, namely spatiotemporal sequence length restriction, minimum and maximum timing gap between events, time window of occurrence of the whole pattern, inclusion or exclusion event constraints, and frequent movement patterns predictive of one ore more classes. The algorithm for mining all frequent constrained patterns is named cAllMOP. Moreover, to control the density of pattern regions a clustering algorithm is exploited. The proposed method is efficient and scalable. Its efficiency is better than that of the previous algorithms AllMOP and GSP with respect to the compactness of discovered knowledge, execution time, and memory requirement.",193,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
2484,3021,Toward a Rule-Based Synthesis of Vietnamese Emotional Speech.,"This paper presents a framework used to simulate four basic emotional styles of Vietnamese speech, by means of acoustic feature transplantation techniques applied to neutral utterances. First, it describes some analyses of acoustic features of Vietnamese emotional speech, accomplished to find the relations between prosodic, voice quality variations and emotional states in Vietnamese speech. Then the target pitch profiles together with duration, energy and spectrum constraints were obtained by applying rules which were inferred from the analysis results and based on the idea that when some emotional speech is synthesized from neutral speech, acoustic features are modified more in some syllables, instead of uniformly modified in all syllables. From there, neutral speech were morphed to produced synthesized speech with emotions. Results of perceptual tests show that emotional styles were well recognized.",193,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning 
2485,3022,Emotional Facial Expression Analysis in the Time Domain.,"Emotions have been studied for a long time and results show that they play an important role in human cognitive functions. In fact, emotions play an extremely important role during the communication between people. And the human face is the most communicative part of the body for expressing emotions; it is recognized that a link exists between facial activity and emotional states. In order to make computer applications more believable and friendly, giving them the ability to recognize and/or express emotions are research fields which have been much focused on. Being able to perform these tasks, firstly, we need to have knowledge about the relationship between emotion and facial activity. Up to now, there have been proposed researches on this relationship. However, almost all these researches focused on analyzing the relationship without taking into account time factors. They analyzed the relationship but did not examined it in the time domain. In this paper, we propose a work on analyzing the relationship between emotions and facial activity in the time domain. Our goal is finding the temporal patterns of facial activity of six basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, disgust). To perform this task, we analyzed a spontaneous video database in order to consider how facial activities which are related to the six basic emotions happen temporally. From there, we bring out the general temporal patterns for facial expressions of each of the six emotions.",193,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

2487,3024,Efficiency Improvements for Fuzzy Associative Memory.,"FAM is an Associative Memory that uses operators of Fuzzy Logic and Mathematical Morphology (MM). FAMs possess important advantages including noise tolerance, unlimited storage, and one pass convergence. An important property, deciding FAM performance, is the ability to capture contents of each pattern, and associations of patterns. Standard FAMs capture either contents or associations of patterns well, but not both of them. In this paper, we propose a novel FAM that effectively stores both contents and associations of patterns. We improve both learning and recalling processes of FAM. In learning process, the associations and contents are stored by mean of input and output patterns and they are generalised by erosion operator. In recalling process, a new threshold is added to output function to improve outputs. Experiments show that noise tolerance of the proposed FAM is better than standard FAMs with different types of noise.",193,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

In the learning process, Fuzzy ARTs update the weight vector of the wining category based on the current input pattern from training data. Fuzzy ARTs, however, only learn from patterns whose values are smaller than values of stored patterns. In this paper, we propose a max-min learning rule of Fuzzy ART that learns all patterns of training data and reduces effect of abnormal training patterns. Our learning rule changes the weight vector of the wining category based on the minimal difference between the current input pattern and the old weight vector of the wining category. We have also conducted experiments on seven benchmark datasets to prove the effectiveness of the proposed learning rule. Experiment results show that clustering results of Fuzzy ART with our learning rule (Max-min Fuzzy ART) is significantly higher than that of other models in complex datasets.",193,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

In 3D reconstruction, especially in skull-based 3D facial reconstruction, features usually play an important role. Because, the accuracy in feature detection strongly affects the accuracy of the 3D final model. In this paper, we concentrate on accuracy of 3D reconstructed skull, one important part in skull-based 3D facial reconstruction.

2490,3027,A Study on Prosody of Vietnamese Emotional Speech.,"This paper describes the analyses of the prosody of Vietnamese emotional speech, accomplished to find the relations between prosodic variations and emotional states in Vietnamese speech. These relations were obtained by investigating the variations of prosodic features in Vietnamese emotional speech in comparison with prosodic features of neutral speech. The analyses were performed on a multi-style emotional speech database which consisted of Vietnamese sentences uttered in different styles. Specifically, four emotional styles were considered: happiness, sadness, cold anger, and hot anger. Speech data in the neutral style were also collected, and prosodic differences of each style with respect to this neutral baseline were quantified. The acoustic features related to prosody which were investigated were fundamental frequency, power, and duration. According to the analysis results, for each speaker of the database, a set of prosodic variation coefficients was produced for each emotional style. This will help for bringing emotions into Vietnamese synthesized speech, making them more natural.",193,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach 
2491,3028,A New Learning Strategy of General BAMs.,"Bi-directional Associative Memory (BAM) is an artificial neural network that consists of two Hopfield networks. The most important advantage of BAM is the ability to recall a stored pattern from a noisy input, which depends on learning process. Between two learning types of iterative learning and non-iterative learning, the former allows better noise tolerance than the latter. However, interactive learning BAMs take longer to learn. In this paper, we propose a new learning strategy that assures our BAM converges in all states, which means that our BAM recalls perfectly all learning pairs. Moreover, our BAM learns faster, more flexibility and tolerates noise better. In order to prove the effectiveness of the model, we have compared our model to existing ones by theory and by experiments.",193,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem 
2492,3029,A New Effective Learning Rule of Fuzzy ART.,"Unsupervised neural networks are known for their ability to cluster inputs into categories based on the similarity among inputs. Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy ART) is a kind of unsupervised neural networks that learns training data until satisfying a given need. In the learning process, weights of categories are changed to adapt to noisy inputs. In other words, learning process decides the quality of clustering. Thus, updating weights of categories is an important step of learning process. We propose a new effective learning rule for Fuzzy ART to improve clustering. Our learning rule modifies weights of categories based on the ratio of the input to the weight of chosen category and a learning rate. The learning rate presents the speed of increasing/decreasing the weight of chosen category. It is changed by the following rule: the number of inputs is larger, value is smaller. We have conducted experiments on ten typical data sets to prove the effectiveness of our novel model. Result from experiments shows that our novel model clusters better than existing models, including Original Fuzzy ART, Complement Fuzzy ART, K-mean algorithm, Euclidean ART.",193,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
2493,3030,A semi-interactive panorama based 3D reconstruction framework for indoor scenes.,"We present a semi-interactive method for 3D reconstruction specialized for indoor scenes which combines computer vision techniques with efficient interaction. We use panoramas, popularly used for visualization of indoor scenes, but clearly not able to show depth, for their great field of view, as the starting point. Exploiting user defined knowledge, in term of a rough sketch of orthogonality and parallelism in scenes, we design smart interaction techniques to semi-automatically reconstruct a scene from coarse to fine level. The framework is flexible and efficient. Users can build a coarse walls-and-floor textured model in five mouse clicks, or a detailed model showing all furniture in a couple of minutes interaction. We show results of reconstruction on four different scenes. The accuracy of the reconstructed models is quite high, around 1% error at full room scale. Thus, our framework is a good choice for applications requiring accuracy as well as application requiring a 3D impression of the scene.",193,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach 
2494,3031,Facial Soft Tissue Thicknesses Prediction Using Anthropometric Distances.,"Predicting the face of an unidentified individual from its skeletal remains is a difficult matter. Obviously, if the soft tissue thicknesses at every location at the skull are known, we can easily rebuild the face from the skull model. Thus, the problem turns out to be predicting the soft tissue thicknesses for any given skull. With the rapid development of the computer, different techniques are being used in the community for prediction tasks and in recent years the concept of neural networks has emerged as one of them. The principal strength of the neural network is its ability to find patterns and irregularities as well as detecting multi-dimensional non-linear connections in data. In this paper, we propose a method of applying neural networks to predict the soft tissue thicknesses for facial reconstruction. We use the distances between anthropometric locations at the skull as input, and the soft tissue thicknesses as output, as this format is suitable for many machine learning mechanisms. These data is collected and measured from candidates using the Computed Tomography (CT) technique",193,4,based using model vietnamese data search algorithm optimization mobile recognition problem routing system learning approach

Firstly, the level set method is applied on CT scanned data to segment the data in the form of implicit function having two values, which mean inside and outside of the boundary of the shape. Next, corners and sharp edges are detected and extracted from the boundary of the shape. The corners are detected based on Sobel-like mask convolution processing with a marching cube. The sharp edges are detected based on Canny-like mask convolution. In this step, a noisy removal module is included. In the paper, the result of detecting both features is presented.",193,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning

As a result, the estimated MV is often suboptimal since the residual bitrate is not considered, which results in the deterioration of the coding efficiency. In this paper, we propose an MV refinement algorithm in which the final MV is selected from a set of candidate MVs by using the RDO including the residual bitrate. To further improve the performance of optimal MV selection, the RD calculation method in the RDO is modified using the deblocking filters. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional H.264 in terms of coding efficiency",193,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2497,3034,3D Facial Reconstruction System from Skull for Vietnamese.,"Reconstructing the 3D facial model of an unidentified individual from his skull contributes considerable benefits to terms of archaeology, anthropology and forensic investigation but it is still significantly complicated matter. Computer aided system of 3D facial reconstruction based on skull has a great advantage of reduction in time consumption. Nevertheless, existing results either contain graphical artifacts or reflect incorrectly differences among reconstructed faces. In this paper, we propose a Vietnamese 3D facial reconstruction system from skull that can overcome existing problems. Machine learning is applied to CT image database of living Vietnamese to learn the relationship between skull measurements and soft tissue thicknesses. Then, the soft tissue thicknesses for each individual are calculated from his/her skull measurements. Moreover, instead of using a fixed number of dowels, extra dowels are added to deform a 3D template face, which ensures the smoothness of the 3D reconstructed face as well as represents best the characteristics of the face to be reconstructed.",193,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
2498,3035,Improvement of Single-Trial EEG Classifier Accuracy Based on Combination of Optimal Spatial Filters and Time-Domain Features.,"Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a popular technique in feature extraction for brain-computer interface (BCI). However, CSP algorithm itself does not perform well since the estimation of covariance matrices is quite sensitive to training data. This causes over fitting in some cases, especially when the training set is small. Moreover, this method may result in poor outcomes because it just computes features on spatial domain but omit those on other domains. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach. Through improving the CSP algorithm, optimal spatial filters with highest discriminative ability will be extracted. Concurrently, we also incorporate some time-domain information into feature vectors to make the signal presentation become more sufficient. Experiment results show that this is a promising method for an electroencephalography (EEG) - based brain-computer interface system.",193,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path

2500,3037,Multi-agent Based Simulation of Traffic in Vietnam.,"There is always need for a good simulation for traffic in Vietnam in order to help transportation planners to improve the current traffic system. Over recent days, there has been severe traffic congestion in many streets of big cities in Vietnam such as Hanoi and HoChiMinh city. There is an urgent need for measures to deal with increasing congestions. The simulation of traffic in Vietnam is a hard problem due to two main reasons including: (1) the traffic participants in Vietnam do not give way according to the rule; (2) the participants do not consider that when waiting for the vehicles in front, stopping in the intersection is obstructing the traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent based simulation system for traffic in Vietnam to help transportation planners to find treatments to the problem of congestion of the traffic system in Vietnam as well as to test new designs before committing resources to actually building the transportation infrastructure. By allowing a user to design different road systems as well as to create different simulation scenarios with different agent profiles, our system can simulate the dynamic of traffic in Vietnam in different situations.",193,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
2501,3038,Supervising an Unsupervised Neural Network.,"Machine learning is the field that is dedicated to the design and development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to ""learn"". Two common types of learning that are often mentioned are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. One often understands that in supervised learning, the system is given the desired output, and it is required to produce the correct output for the given input, while in unsupervised learning the system is given only the input and the objective is to find the natural structure inherent in the input data. We, however, suggest that even with unsupervised learning, the information inside the input, the structure of the input, and the sequence that the input is given to the system actually make the learning ""supervised"" in some way. Therefore, we recommend that in order to make the machine learn, even in a ""supervised"" manner, we should use an ""unsupervised learning"" model together with an appropriate way of presenting the input. We propose in this paper a simple plasticity neural network model that has the ability of storing information as well as storing the association between a pair of inputs. We then introduce two simple unsupervised learning rules and a framework to supervise our neural network.",193,13,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm problem recognition routing system mobile approach learning

In this paper, we focus on addressing this problem for Vietnamese documents which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before. Most of the current algorithms have been designed for English which are not directly applicable to Vietnamese - a monosyllabic language. We propose to combine Charikarpsilas algorithm (Alexander Andoni et al., 2006) with a ldquoweighting schemerdquo and Vietnamese specific features to address the language intricacy.

2503,3040,Recognizing Vietnamese Online Handwritten Separated Characters.,"Vietnamese alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet with the addition of nine accent marks or diacritics - four of them to create additional sounds, and the other five to indicate the tone of each word. Because Vietnamese is a tonal language that uses tone to distinguish words, recognizing diacritics is an important part in recognizing Vietnamese word. However, in written form, diacritics are much smaller then the characters, which make very them hard to recognize. Previous works on Vietnamese characters recognition often pre-process input with a graph-based approach by trying to separate the main characters with their diacritics by determining connected regions at pixel level. This approach, however, only works well where the input contains only characters with separable diacritics, for example, scanned image of printed documents. We propose in this paper a robust method to recognize online Vietnamese characters with diacritics. Using cosine transformation with appropriated sampling algorithms, we represent multiple strokes of a character together in a single set of features. This set of features is then used as the input for a well designed machine learning based system. We have tested our system on the combination of Vietnamese characters with diacritics and Section 1c (isolated characters) of the Unipen data set, and have obtained very competitive results.",193,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

There are two main approaches to solve the diacritics recognition problems. The first approach tries to separate diacritics from their main character and recognizes them independently. This approach, however, should only be applied with printed documents as the diacritics of printed characters are separable. With free-styled handwritten characters, diacritics are very hard to separate and recognize because they may overlap main characters. The second approach tries to recognize both main character and diacritics without separation step.

In this paper, we present a framework for large scale multi-agent based simulation on grid. We have modified the desktop grid platform BOINC for multi-agent based simulation.

However, handwriting character recognition is not a trivial task for computer. Based on the presentation of the input, handwriting recognition can be divided into two classes: offline and online. The main advantage of online handwritten data over offline data is the availability of stroke segmentation and order of writing. Utilizing this information rather than static image only can obtain higher recognition rate [11]. In this paper, we extend the method proposed in [13] to represent multiple strokes of a character together in a single set of features using cosine transformation. Using this representation, we have developed an online writer-independent character recognition system with MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, one classifier for each single character.

In order to do so, conversational agents are simulated with emotion and personality as well as communicative channels such as voice, head and eye movement, manipulator and facial expression. Up to now, creating facial expression from emotions has received much attention. However, most of the work concentrates on producing static facial expressions from emotions. In this paper, we propose a scheme for displaying continuous emotional states of a conversational agent on a 3D face. The main idea behind the scheme is that an emotional facial expression happens for a few seconds only when there is a significant change in the emotional states. This makes the emotional facial expressions of the conversational agents more realistic due to the fact that a facial expression only stay on the face for a few seconds.",193,1,based using model data search vietnamese optimization mobile system approach learning algorithm recognition problem path

Realistic animation of these movements improves the realism, liveliness of the interaction between human and computers using embodied conversational agents. To date, no appropriate methods have been proposed for integrating all facial movements. We propose in this paper a scheme of combining facial movements on a 3D talking head.

This blockchain network will serve two purposes, i.e., generate the real traffic data (including both normal data and attack data) for our learning models and implement real-time experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed intrusion detection framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset that is synthesized in a laboratory for cyberattacks in a blockchain network. We then propose a novel collaborative learning model that allows efficient deployment in the blockchain network to detect attacks. The main idea of the proposed learning model is to enable blockchain nodes to actively collect data, share the knowledge learned from its data, and then exchange the knowledge with other blockchain nodes in the network. In this way, we can not only leverage the knowledge from all the nodes in the network but also do not need to gather all raw data for training at a centralized node like conventional centralized learning solutions.

2518,3057,An Effective Framework of Private Ethereum Blockchain Networks for Smart Grid.,"A smart grid is an important application in Industry 4.0 with a lot of new technologies and equipment working together. Hence, sensitive data stored in the smart grid is vulnerable to malicious modification and theft. This paper proposes a framework to build a smart grid based on a highly effective private Ethereum network. Our framework provides a real smart grid that includes modern hardware and a smart contract to secure data in the blockchain network. To obtain high throughput but a low uncle rate, the difficulty calculation method used in the mining process of the Ethereum consensus mechanism is modified to adapt to the practical smart grid setup. The performance in terms of throughput and latency are evaluated by simulation and verified by the real smart grid setup. The enhanced private Ethereum-based smart grid has significantly better performance than the public one. Moreover, this framework can be applied to any system used to store data in the Ethereum network.",195,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2519,3058,A Hierarchical Long Short-Term Memory Encoder-Decoder Model for Abstractive Summarization.,"Abstractive summarization is the task of generating concise summary of a source text, which is a challenging problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Many recent studies have relied on encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence deep neural networks to solve this problem. However, most of these models treat the input as a sequence of words at the same level during the encoding process. This will make the encoding inefficient, especially for long input texts. Addressing this issue, in this paper we propose a model to encode text in a hierarchical manner, which helps to encode information in a way that is consistent with the nature of the text: the text is synthesized from sentences, and each sentence is synthesized from words. Our proposed model is based on Long Short Term Memory model that we called HLSTM (Hierarchical Long Short Term Memory) and applied to the problem of abstractive summarization. We conducted extensive experiments on the two most popular corpora (Gigaword and Amazon Review) and obtain significant improvements in comparison with the baseline models.",195,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

For this purpose, we improve the technique for responding to membership queries when generating candidate assumptions. This technique is then integrated into a proposed backtracking algorithm to generate local weakest assumptions. These assumptions are effectively used in rechecking the evolving software by reducing time required for assumption regeneration within the proposed framework. The proposed framework can be applied to verify software that is continually evolving.

In this paper, we consider the PLS approach called friendly jamming (FJ), which is more practical thanks to its low computational complexity. State-of-the-art methods require that legitimate users have full channel state information (CSI) of their channel. Thanks to the recent promising application of the autoencoder (AE) in communication, we propose a new FJ method for PLS using AE without prior knowledge of the CSI. The proposed AE-based FJ method can provide good secrecy performance while avoiding explicit CSI estimation. We also apply the recently proposed tool for mutual information neural estimation (MINE) to evaluate the secrecy capacity. Moreover, we leverage MINE to avoid end-to-end learning in AE-based FJ.",195,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

In the problem of paraphrase generation, there are some words which should be ignored in the target text generation. The current models do not pay enough attention to this problem. To overcome this limitation, in this paper we propose a new model which is a penalty coefficient attention-based Residual Long-Short-Term-Memory (PCA-RLSTM) neural network for forming an end-to-end paraphrase generation model.

Dealing with paraphrase generation problem, one of the most intrinsic obstruction of existing solutions do not pay enough attention to the fact that words and sentences in particular context own differential importance. Consequently, the loss of crucial information probably occurs and irrelevant paraphrasing components are generated. To overcome these barriers, an emerging Hierarchical Conditional Attention-based Neural Networks (HCANN) architecture to construct end-to-end text generation framework is proposed. More specifically, included method in that represents hierarchy of document along with conditional decoder for paraphrase generation processes.

GA casts the path coverage test data generation as an optimization problem and applies efficient search-based algorithms to find suitable test cases. GA approaches scale well and can handle any source code and test criteria, but it still has some degrades when program under test has critical path clusters. This paper presents a method for improving GA efficiency by integrating a constraint solver to solve path conditions in which regular GA cannot generate test data for coverage.

An algorithm for generating test scenarios are developed to avoid test paths explosion without having data sharing points of threads in parallel fragments or weak sequencing fragments. Test data are also generated with solving constraints of string variables. We standardize string constraints and equations at the boundary of variables that are input formula of Z3-str solver. Comparing with the current approach of the solver, some preprocessing rules are extended for other operations such as charAt, lastindexOf, trim, startsWith and endsWith.

In this research, we investigate properties of the Vietnamese legal document system and propose a representation for the documents and their interrelationships. The main challenges for this task are their unstability, limited validity period and complicated interrelationships. Properties and relationships which we design to represent in our knowlege base are selective in order to make use of information within legal documents.

In this paper, we propose a work on analysis of how emotional facial activities happen temporally. Our goal is to find the temporal patterns of facial activity of six basic emotions in order to improve the simulation of continuous emotional facial expressions on a 3D face of an embodied agent. Using facial expression recognition techniques, we first analyze a spontaneous video database in order to consider how facial activities are related to six basic emotions temporally.

These actions can be considered as critical properties in many applications which require high level of safety, such as the military, bank or stock software systems. Security policy must be specified clearly in software requirements and then be followed strictly and correctly in implementations. User permission policy is one of the most important aspects in software security policy. This paper proposes an approach for checking the conformance between user permissions of an implementation and their given specifications. In this approach, the source code of a program is represented at an abstraction level called Abstract Syntax Tree, which are then checked against specification of user permissions expressed using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

2531,3072,A runtime approach for estimating resource usage.,"In the era of information explosion, a program is necessary to be scalable. Therefore, scalability analysis becomes very important in software verification and validation. However, current approaches to empirical scalability analysis remain limitations related to the number of supported models and performance. In this paper, we propose a runtime approach for estimating the program resource usage with two aims: evaluating the program scalability and revealing potential errors. In this approach, the resource usage of a program is first observed when it is executed on inputs with different scales, the observed results are then fitted on a model of the usage according to the program's input. Comparing to other approaches, ours supports diverse models to illustrate the resource usage, i.e., linear-log, power-law, polynomial, etc. We currently focus on the computation cost and stack frames usage as two representatives of resource usage, but the approach can be extended to other kinds of resource. The experimental result shows that our approach achieves more precise estimation and better performance than other state-of-the-art approaches.",195,5,based using model vietnamese data search optimization mobile system recognition routing learning algorithm approach problem

In service composition, a composite service may be built from element services which belong to different administrative domains. Therefore, in order to exploit the benefits of service composition, we must carefully consider security issues. One of them is to protect users' information.

However, verifying object invariants at runtime is always a challenging task in software verification. This paper proposes a method for verifying invariants of Java objects at runtime using AOP. Suppose that a software application is designed using UML models and its constraints are specified in OCL expressions, the software is then implemented, by default, using the UML design. They propose to construct verifiable aspects which are automatically generated from OCL constraints. These aspects can be woven into Java code to check whether object invariants are violated at runtime. Benefiting from AOP in separation of crosscutting concerns and weaving mechanisms, generated aspects can do the verification task whenever values of objects' attributes are changed. A Verification Aspect Generator (VAG) tool has been developed allowing the automatic generation of verifying aspects from the UML/OCL constraints.",195,6,using based search vietnamese model mobile data optimization system approach recognition knowledge problem networks method

Due to the expressive power of B notations, however, we cannot describe the parallel processing in the implementation machine, particularly we are not able to express all features (such as AND-forks/joins, OR-forks/joins) of UCMs in a B implementation machine. In this work, we propose an approach to solve the expression problem of UCM features using a graph-based algorithm. The UCM path which describes the interaction between components is extracted and then decomposed into sequential events' paths if it has AND-forks/joins and/or OR-forks/joins.

When a rule needed for solving the problem does not exist, the problem can be solved by using rules similar to the existing rules. In an implementation using SLD procedure, a resolution is executed between a subgoal and a rule if an atom of the subgoal is similar to the consequence atom of the rule. Similarities between atoms are calculated using a knowledge base of words with account of the reasoning situation, and the reliability of the derived solution is calculated based on these similarities. If many solutions are obtained, they are grouped into classes of similar solutions and a representative solution is then selected for each class.

Recent studies have proposed several effective CLSW models for resource- rich language pairs such as English-German, English-French. However, This task has not been effectively addressed for language pairs consisting of Vietnamese and another one. In this paper, we propose a neural network model that exploits cross- lingual lexical resources to learn high-quality cross-lingual word embedding models. Since our neural network model is language- independent, it can learn a truly multilingual space. Furthermore, we introduce a novel cross-lingual semantic word similarity measurement method based on Word Embeddings and Word Definitions (WEWD). Last but not least, we introduce a standard Vietnamese-English dataset for the cross-lingual semantic word similarity measurement task (VESim-1000).

Therefore, automatic detection of antonymy can be leveraged to make contributions to different NLP tasks, such as Machine Translation, Sentiment Analysis, and Information Retrieval. Currently, most prior studies just focus on discriminating between antonyms and synonyms. However, not only synonymy but other semantic relations, such as hypernymy, co-hyponyms, which also get high similarities thereby making it hard to discriminate. Therefore, it is necessary to make a thorough research on identifying antonyms from a wide variety of other semantic relations. In this paper, we aim to identify Vietnamese antonyms pairs according to the vector semantics approach. Specifically, we build up specialized word embedding models by incorporating lexical-semantic resource and distributional information. In addition, we propose specialized Vietnamese features and utilize mutual information between words in order to integrate with word embedding vectors. This aims to generate more meaningful feature vectors for supervised classifiers solving antonym detection problems.

Distinguishing antonyms from synonyms is a key task to achieve high performance in natural language processing systems. Distinguishing between antonyms and synonyms is a hard problem because the co-occurrence distributions of the antonyms or synonyms tend to be highly similar. On the other hand, this issue has been thoroughly studied in English. However, it has not been effectively addressed for Vietnamese. Compared to English, Vietnamese has its own word-level characteristics that indicate the synonymous or antonymous relation. In this paper, we introduce a framework which exploits exhaustively special Vietnamese features to distinguish between antonyms from synonyms. We propose a deep neural network model (ViASNet) that can utilize not only lexico-syntactic information captured from the context of word pairs in a corpus but also its word-level features, and distribution features as well.

However, many languages still lack treebanks and building a treebank can be very complicated and difficult. This work has a twofold objective. Firstly, to share our results in constructing a large Vietnamese treebank (VTB) with three levels of annotation including word segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis. Major steps in the treebank construction process are described with particular regard to specific Vietnamese properties such as lack of word delimiter and isolation. Those properties make sentences highly syntactically ambiguous, and therefore it is difficult to ensure a high level of agreement among annotators. Various studies of Vietnamese syntax were employed not only to define annotations but also to systematically deal with ambiguities. Annotators were supported by automatic labelling tools, which are based on statistical machine learning methods, for sentence pre-processing and a tree editor for supporting manual annotation. As a result, an annotation agreement of around 90 % was achieved. Our second objective is to present our method for automatically finding errors and inconsistencies in treebank corpora and its application to the construction of the VTB. This method employs the Shannon entropy measure in a manner that the more reduced entropy the more corrected errors in a treebank. The method ranks error candidates by using a scoring function based on conditional entropy. Our experiments showed that this method detected high-error-density subsets of original error candidate sets, and that the corpus entropy was significantly reduced after error correction. The size of these subsets was only about one third of the whole set, while these subsets contained 80–90 % of the total errors. This method can also be applied to languages similar to Vietnamese.",196,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

On this basis, we propose an improved method of error detection by transforming syntax trees based on vertical markovization.

The key idea for identifying whether adjacent syllables in a text can form a reduplicative word based on its formation rules. For 2-syllable reduplicative words, this paper uses rules that describe the repeating and the opposing between pairs of initial consonants, rhymes and tones. Then the method is expanded to identify reduplicative words that have 3 or 4 syllables from 2-syllable ones for the Vietnamese word segmentation task. Experimental results showed that the F1-score was improved to 98.61% and that word segmentation errors were reduced significantly, 1.26%.",196,3,based using model data vietnamese search optimization mobile algorithm problem system recognition routing approach path 
2557,3100,An Efficient Framework for Extracting Parallel Sentences from Non-Parallel Corpora.,"Automatically building a large bilingual corpus that contains millions of words is always a challenging task. In particular in case of low-resource languages, it is difficult to find an existing parallel corpus which is large enough for building a real statistical machine translation. However, comparable non-parallel corpora are richly available in the Internet environment, such as in Wikipedia, and from which we can extract valuable parallel texts. This work presents a framework for effectively extracting parallel sentences from that resource, which results in significantly improving the performance of statistical machine translation systems. Our framework is a bootstrapping-based method that is strengthened by using a new measurement for estimating the similarity between two bilingual sentences. We conduct experiment for the language pair of English and Vietnamese and obtain promising results on both constructing parallel corpora and improving the accuracy of machine translation from English to Vietnamese.",196,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

Recently, there have been a number of studies on integrating word sense disambiguation (WSD) into phrase-based SMT. The WSD score has been used as a feature of translation.

This paper presents a method for solving WSI problem based on the context clustering approach. The idea behind this approach is that similar contexts indicate similar meanings. Specifically, we have successfully applied Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to partition contexts of a word into clusters, each representing a sense of that word. Different from some previous systems where a single model is built for all words, in our system, each word has its own model. Experimental result on the SemEval-2010 dataset shows that CTM is a strong tool for modelling the word's contexts. Our system has significantly better performance than all systems participated in the SemEval-2010 workshop. In comparison to the use of other topic models for WSI, our system can explore additional useful information which is the relationship between senses of a word. The prospect of using CTM for discovering the correlation between senses of multiple words is also discussed at the end of this paper.",196,8,based using model vietnamese data algorithm search optimization mobile system learning problem recognition routing approach

These methods are based on two principles that high entropy implies high possibility of error and that entropy is reduced after error correction. The first method ranks error candidates using a scoring function based on conditional entropy. The second method uses beam search to find a subset of error candidates in which the change of labels leads to decreasing of conditional entropy. We carried out experiments with Vietnamese tree bank corpus at two levels of annotation including word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. Our experiments showed that these methods detected high-error-density subsets of original error candidate sets. The size of these subsets is only one third the size of whole sets, while these subsets contain 80%-90% of errors in whole sets.

We design syntactic transformation models using unlexicalized form of synchronous context-free grammars. These models can be learned from sourceparsed bitext. Our system can naturally make use of both constituent and non-constituent phrasal translations in the decoding phase. We considered various levels of syntactic analysis ranging from chunking to full parsing.

2574,3119,iK-means: an improvement of the iterative k-means partitioning algorithm.,"The evolutionary processes vary among sites of an alignment that strongly affect the accuracy of phylogenetic tree reconstruction. Partitioning an alignment into sub-alignments of sites such that the evolutionary processes at sites in the same sub-alignment are highly similar is a proper strategy. Gene features might be used as reasonable indicators to partition an alignment. However, the gene feature information is not always available or efficient Computational partitioning methods like iterative k-means has been proposed to automatically partition sites into groups based on the similarity of evolutionary rates of sites. Despite obtaining compelling results in terms of AICc and BIC measurements, the k-means method forms a group of all and only invariant sites that results in bias/wrong phylogenetic trees. In this paper, we improve the k-means algorithm by re-classifying invariant sites into different sub-alignments based on their likelihood values. Experimental results on simulated and empirical DNA datasets showed that the new method, called iK-means, overcame the pitfall of the K-means method, consequently, helps improve the quality of the partitioning sub-alignments. We recommend using the iK-means method to level up the accuracy in inferring phylogenetic trees.",197,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

Meanwhile, the legitimate monitor (LM) simultaneously transmits jamming signals, listens to suspicious links, decode-and-forward (DF) the eavesdropped information to the legitimate eavesdropper (LE). Based on the proposed mechanism, we investigate the power allocation policies for jamming signals of the legitimate monitor under deterministic and non-deterministic interference channel.

SSTBC preserves energy by turning off radio (entering sleep mode) of either impossible or unnecessary nodes, which observe almost the same information, base on their location information to remove redundant data. In addition, to further reduce energy dissipation of communication in network, we build minimum spanning tree with the root as the cluster head (CH) from active nodes in a cluster to forward data packets to base station (BS).

2592,3139,"Liver Cancer Detection by a Simple, Inexpensive and Effective Immunosensor with Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles.","Regular monitoring of blood α-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) levels is important for the routine screening of liver cancer. However, AFP and CEA have a much lower specificity than des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (DCP) to detect liver cancer. Therefore, the study reported here was designed, to develop a screen-printed DCP immunosensor incorporating zinc oxide nanoparticles, for accurate determination of DCP. The designed immunosensor shows low detection limits for the detection of DCP: 0.440 ng/mL (based on impedance measurement), 0.081 ng/mL (based on real part of impedance measurement) and 0.078 ng/mL (based on imaginary part of impedance measurement), within the range of 3.125 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL. In addition, there was little interference to DCP determination by molecules such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, glucose, urea, and uric acid. It is therefore concluded that the DCP immunosensor developed and reported here is simple, inexpensive and effective, and shows promise in the rapid screening of early-stage liver cancer at home with a point-of-care approach",222,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system 
2593,3140,Evaluation of Sampling-Based Ensembles of Classifiers on Imbalanced Data for Software Defect Prediction Problems.,"Defect prediction in software projects plays a crucial role to reduce quality-based risk and increase the capability of detecting faulty program modules. Hence, classification approaches to anticipate software defect proneness based on static code characteristics have become a hot topic with a great deal of attention in recent years. While several novel studies show that the use of a single classifier causes the performance bottleneck, ensembles of classifiers might effectively enhance classification performance compared to a single classifier. However, the class imbalance property of software defect data severely hinders the classification efficiency of ensemble learning. To cope with this problem, resampling methods are usually combined into ensemble models. This paper empirically assesses the importance of sampling with regard to ensembles of various classifiers on imbalanced data in software defect prediction problems. Extensive experiments with the combination of seven different kinds of classification algorithms, three sampling methods, and two balanced data learning schemata were conducted over ten datasets. Empirical results indicated the positive effects of combining sampling techniques and the ensemble learning model on the performance of defect prediction regarding datasets with imbalanced class distributions.",225,14,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm recognition optimization routing mobile system problem networks learning 
2594,3141,Binary teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm with a new update mechanism for sample subset optimization in software defect prediction.,"Software defect prediction has gained considerable attention in recent years. A broad range of computational methods has been developed for accurate prediction of faulty modules based on code and design metrics. One of the challenges in training classifiers is the highly imbalanced class distribution in available datasets, leading to an undesirable bias in the prediction performance for the minority class. Data sampling is a widespread technique to tackle this problem. However, traditional sampling methods, which depend mainly on random resampling from a given dataset, do not take advantage of useful information available in training sets, such as sample quality and representative instances. To cope with this limitation, evolutionary undersampling methods are usually used for identifying an optimal sample subset for the training dataset. This paper proposes a binary teaching–learning- based optimization algorithm employing a distribution-based solution update rule, namely BTLBOd, to generate a balanced subset of highly valuable examples. This subset is then applied to train a classifier for reliable prediction of potentially defective modules in a software system. Each individual in BTLBOd includes two vectors: a real-valued vector generated by the distribution-based update mechanism, and a binary vector produced from the corresponding real vector by a proposed mapping function. Empirical results showed that the optimal sample subset produced by BTLBOd might ameliorate the classification accuracy of the predictor on highly imbalanced software defect data. Obtained results also demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed sampling method compared to other popular sampling techniques.",225,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning

The proposed mechanism uses prioritization on two stages to enhance the ability to support quality of service (QoS) in networks with a high density of access points (APs). First step: in the competition between APs, only one AP can get the right to access the environment. This step helps reduce the collision and influence of hidden node problems. Second step: that AP uses a multipolling mechanism to poll all stations (STAs) in a prioritized group m. This step helps reduce delay and polling overhead. The major innovation is the use of multipolling mechanism for WLAN network with multiple APs instead of WLAN network with single AP. We propose Polling List Update (PLU) and Multi Polling Prioritized period (MPP) frames. The PLU frame is used to collect information from STAs and update polling list. The MPP frame coordinates data transmissions without collision. Comparing with the single polling scheme used in the conventional IEEE802.11 MAC protocol, the proposed scheme can reduce the overhead caused by the polling frames.

Then we rotated the adversarial image and gave them to the recognizer to find the recognizer to regain the correct recognition. Thus, we empirically confirmed rotation to images can protect pattern recognizer based on neural networks from adversarial example attacks.",244,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple 
2627,3174,A Spatial-Pyramid Scene Categorization Algorithm based on Locality-aware Sparse Coding.,"Scene recognition has a wide range of applications, such as object recognition and detection, content-based image indexing and retrieval, and intelligent vehicle and robot navigation. In particular, natural scene images tend to be very complex and are difficult to analyze due to changes of illumination and transformation. In this study, we investigate a novel model to learn and recognize scenes in nature by combining locality constrained sparse coding (LCSP), Spatial Pyramid Pooling, and linear SVM in end-to-end model. First, interesting points for each image in the training set are characterized by a collection of local features, known as codewords, obtained using dense SIFT descriptor. Each codeword is represented as part of a topic. Then, we employ LCSP algorithm to learn the codeword distribution of those local features from the training images. Next, a modified Spatial Pyramid Pooling model is employed to encode the spatial distribution of the local features. For the final stage, a linear SVM is employed to classify local features encoded by Spatial Pyramid Pooling. Experimental evaluations on several benchmarks well demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art visual descriptors.",244,10,based using model vietnamese data search optimization algorithm system mobile problem routing recognition learning approach

However, in practical implementations, an IDS is a complex work and needs investing in the new infrastructure or in training new personnel. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the users who has a small network system. In this paper, we introduce an IDSCloud model as a solution to implementing a network IDS based on cloud computing.

2629,3176,A Pessimistic Approach for Solving a Multi-criteria Decision Making.,"An extension of the DS/AHP method in the paper. The extension assumes that expert judgments concerning the criteria are often imprecise and incomplete. The proposed extension also uses groups of experts or decision makers for comparing decision alternatives and criteria. However, it does not require assigning favorable values for different groups of decision alternatives and criteria. The computation procedure for processing and aggregating the incomplete information about criteria and decision alternatives is reduced to solving a finite set of linear programming problems. Main results are explained and illustrated by numerical examples.",244,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

2632,3179,Experimental Study on Software Fault Prediction Using Machine Learning Model.,"Faults are the leading cause of time consuming and cost wasting during software life cycle. Predicting faults in early stage improves the quality and reliability of the system and also reduces cost for software development. Many researches proved that software metrics are effective elements for software fault prediction. In addition, many machine learning techniques have been developed for software fault prediction. It is important to determine which set of metrics are effective for predicting fault by using machine learning techniques.

Interactive multimodal applications are currently present in many such critical systems. An interactive multimodal application processes two or more combined user input modes. Testing such applications requires suitable methods and tools. In this paper, we propose to extend a previously proposed approach to generate test data for interactive multimodal applications by adding the use of neural networks. In this new approach, the application is modeled with the TTT language (as previously), but test data are generated by analyzing not only the TTT model but also the test cases previously obtained. Preliminary experimental results show the approach is promising.",246,2,based using model data vietnamese search algorithm optimization mobile problem routing recognition system approach learning 
2634,3181,A Solution For Improving The Effectiveness of Higher Order Mutation Testing.,"Testing plays a crucial role in software development for ensuring quality. Mutation testing in general and higher order mutation in particular are the good techniques to evaluate the quality of test data, i.e. determining if test data can uncover errors. However, higher order mutation is often very costly because of huge number of generated mutants. In this work, we focus on reducing the cost of higher order mutation testing. We propose different strategies to combine first order mutants to generate less number of higher order mutants for a program under test, but keep the quality of generated mutants. The proposed strategies are experimented on a set of different programs and the results show the effectiveness in terms of number of generated mutants and mutation score.",246,12,based using model search data vietnamese optimization recognition approach mobile problem path routing learning system

In particular, Lustre is suitable for developing real-time systems. In such applications, testing activities for fault detection play a very important role. Mutation testing is one of the most commonly used techniques for evaluating the probability of fault detection of test data. Typically, the mutants generated by a set of mutation operators of a programming language are very large, so the manual mutant generation is often very costly. In this paper. we present a mutants generator by using the set of mutation operators defined for the Lustre language. Automatic mutants generation strategy is implemented in the generator in order to reduce test cost. Mutant generation and random test data generation are also experimented on different Lustre programs.",246,0,based using model data vietnamese search optimization algorithm mobile routing problem system recognition learning approach

As a result, thoroughly testing such applications is particularly important and requires more effort than for traditional interactive applications. In this paper, we propose an approach for automating the test generation of such multimodal applications. This approach is based on the definition of a new test modelling language, TTT.

2638,3185,A regression testing approach for Lustre/SCADE programs.,"Software maintenance is an activity which includes enhancements, error corrections, optimization and deletion of existing features. These modifications may cause the system to work incorrectly. Therefore, regression testing becomes necessary. Regression testing is any type of software testing that seeks to uncover new software bugs, or regressions, in existing functional and non-functional areas of a system after changes, such as enhancements, patches or configuration changes, have been made to them. During the software maintenance phase, regression testing is certainly an expensive but necessary activity to make sure the new versions of the system do not ""regress"". As software evolves, chances are that not only the implementation changes, but that the specification of the system changes too. We argue that guiding regression testing by the system specifications will be more accurate and cost effective. Lustre is a formal synchronous declarative language widely used for modeling and specifying safety critical applications in the fields of avionics, transportation, and energy production. In such applications, the testing activity to ensure correctness of the system plays a crucial role. During the development process, Lustre programs are often upgraded, so regression testing should be performed to detect bugs. In this paper, we present an approach to generate test cases in regression testing of Lustre programs. In this approach, a Lustre program is modeled by an operator network, then we determine the set of paths and compute symbolically the path activation conditions for each version. Test cases for regression are generated by comparing paths between versions. We apply this approach on a case study for regression testing of a Heater Controller System.",246,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple

The randomness of passenger arrivals at bus stops and external factors (such as traffic congestion and bad weather) in high frequency transit operations often cause irregular headway that can result in decreased service reliability. The approach proposed in this paper, which has the capability of handling the uncertainty of transit operations based on Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm using a dynamic Bayesian network, applies preventive strategies to forestall bus unreliability and, where unreliability is evident, restore reliability using corrective strategies. “Holding”, “expressing”, “short-turning” and “deadheading” are the corrective strategies considered in this paper.",251,11,based using model data vietnamese search optimization problem mobile routing recognition system algorithm approach multiple
